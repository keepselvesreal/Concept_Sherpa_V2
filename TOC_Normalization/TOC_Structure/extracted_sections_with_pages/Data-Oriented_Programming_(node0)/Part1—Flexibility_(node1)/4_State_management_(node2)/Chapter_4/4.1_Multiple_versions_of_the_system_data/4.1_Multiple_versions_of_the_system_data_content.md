State management
Time travel
This chapter covers
 A multi-version approach to state management
 The calculation phase of a mutation
 The commit phase of a mutation
 Keeping a history of previous state versions
So far, we have seen how DOP handles queries via generic functions that access sys-
tem data, which is represented as a hash map. In this chapter, we illustrate how
DOP deals with mutations (requests that change the system state). Instead of updat-
ing the state in place, we maintain multiple versions of the system data. At a specific
point in time, the system state refers to a specific version of the system data. This
chapter is a deep dive in the third principle of DOP.
PRINCIPLE #3 Data is immutable.
The maintenance of multiple versions of the system data requires the data to be
immutable. This is made efficient both in terms of computation and memory via a
