State management
Time travel
This chapter covers
 A multi-version approach to state management
 The calculation phase of a mutation
 The commit phase of a mutation
 Keeping a history of previous state versions
So far, we have seen how DOP handles queries via generic functions that access sys-
tem data, which is represented as a hash map. In this chapter, we illustrate how
DOP deals with mutations (requests that change the system state). Instead of updat-
ing the state in place, we maintain multiple versions of the system data. At a specific
point in time, the system state refers to a specific version of the system data. This
chapter is a deep dive in the third principle of DOP.
PRINCIPLE #3 Data is immutable.
The maintenance of multiple versions of the system data requires the data to be
immutable. This is made efficient both in terms of computation and memory via a

technique called structural sharing, where parts of the data that are common between
two versions are shared instead of being copied. In DOP, a mutation is split into two
distinct phases:
 In the calculation phase, we compute the next version of the system data.
 In the commit phase, we move the system state forward so that it refers to the
version of the system data computed by the calculation phase.
This distinction between calculation and commit phases allows us to reduce the part
of our system that is stateful to its bare minimum. Only the code of the commit phase
is stateful, while the code in the calculation phase of a mutation is stateless and is
made of generic functions similar to the code of a query. The implementation of the
commit phase is common to all mutations. As a consequence, inside the commit
phase, we have the ability to ensure that the state always refers to a valid version of the
system data.
Another benefit of this state management approach is that we can keep track of
the history of previous versions of the system data. Restoring the system to a previous
state (if needed) becomes straightforward. Table 4.1 shows the two phases.

Calculation Computes the next version of system data Stateless Specific
Commit Moves the system state forward Stateful Common
In this chapter, we assume that no mutations occur concurrently in our system. In the
next chapter, we will deal with concurrency control.
4.1 Multiple versions of the system data
When Joe comes in to the office on Monday, he tells Theo that he needs to exercise before
starting to work with his mind. Theo and Joe go for a walk around the block, and the dis-
cussion turns toward version control systems. They discuss how Git keeps track of the
whole commit history and how easy and fast it is to restore the code to a previous state.
When Theo tells Joe that Git’s ability to “time travel” reminds him one of his favorite mov-
ies, Back to the Future, Joe shares that a month ago he watched the Back to the Future trilogy
with Neriah, his 14-year-old son.
Their walk complete, they arrive back at Theo’s office. Theo and Joe partake of the
espresso machine in the kitchen before they begin today’s lesson.
Joe So far, we’ve seen how we manage queries that retrieve information from the
system in DOP. Now I’m going to show you how we manage mutations. By a
mutation, I mean an operation that changes the state of the system.
 NOTE A mutation is an operation that changes the state of the system.

4.1 Multiple versions of the system data 73
Theo Is there a fundamental difference between queries and mutations in DOP?
After all, the whole state of the system is represented as a hash map. I could
easily write code that modifies part of the hash map, and it would be similar to
the code that retrieves information from the hash map.
Joe You could mutate the data in place, but then it would be challenging to ensure
that the code of a mutation doesn’t put the system into an invalid date. You
would also lose the ability to track previous versions of the system state.
Theo I see. So, how do you handle mutations in DOP?
Joe We adopt a multi-version state approach, similar to what a version control sys-
tem like Git does; we manage different versions of the system data. At a specific
point in time, the state of the system refers to a version of the system data. After
a mutation is executed, we move the reference forward.
Theo I’m confused. Is the system state mutable or immutable?
Joe The data is immutable, but the state reference is mutable.
TIP The data is immutable, but the state reference is mutable.
Noticing the look of confusion on Theo’s face, Joe draws a quick diagram on the white-
board. He then shows Theo figure 4.1, hoping that it will clear up Theo’s perplexity.
After mutation B After mutation C
Data V10 Data V10
MutationA MutationA
Data V11 Data V11
Mutation B Mutation B
System State Data V12 Data V12
Mutation C
System State Data V13
Figure 4.1 After mutation B is executed, the system state refers to Data V12. After
mutation C is executed, the system state refers to Data V13.
Theo Does that mean that before the code of a mutation runs, we make a copy of the
system data?
Joe No, that would be inefficient, as we would have to do a deep copy of the data.
