14 CHAPTER 1 Complexity of object-orientedprogramming
In the remaining sections of this chapter, we will illustrate each of the previous
aspects, summarized in table 1.1. We’ll look at this in the context of the Klafim project
and explain in what sense these aspects are a source of complexity.
Table 1.1 Aspects of OOP and their impact on system complexity
Aspect Impact on complexity
Code and data are mixed. Classes tend to be involved in many relations.
Objects are mutable. Extra thinking is needed when reading code.
Objects are mutable. Explicit synchronization is required on multi-threaded environments.
Data is locked in objects. Data serialization is not trivial.
Code is locked in classes. Class hierarchies are complex.
1.2.1 Many relations between classes
One way to assess the complexity of a class diagram is to look only at the entities and
their relations, ignoring members and methods, as in figure 1.10. When we design a
system, we have to define the relations between different pieces of code and data.
That’s unavoidable.

TIP In OOP, code and data are mixed together in classes: data as members and code as
methods.

1.2 Sources of complexity 15
From a system analysis perspective, the fact that code and data are mixed together
makes the system complex in the sense that entities tend to be involved in many rela-
tions. In figure 1.11, we take a closer look at the Member class. Member is involved in five
relations: two data relations and three code relations.
 Data relations:
– Library has many Members.
– Member has many BookLendings.
 Code relations:
– Member extends User.
– Librarian uses Member.
– Member uses BookItem.

involved in five relations.
Imagine for a moment that we were able, somehow, to split the Member class into two
separate entities:
 MemberCode for the code
 MemberData for the data
Instead of a Member class with five relations, we would have the diagram shown in fig-
ure 1.12 with:
 A MemberCode entity and three relations.
 A MemberData entity and two relations.
