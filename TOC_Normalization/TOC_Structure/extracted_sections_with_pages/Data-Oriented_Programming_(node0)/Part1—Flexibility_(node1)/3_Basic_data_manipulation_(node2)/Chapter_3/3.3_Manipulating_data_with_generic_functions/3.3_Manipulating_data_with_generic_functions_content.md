Basic data manipulation
Meditation and programming
This chapter covers
 Representing records with string maps to improve
flexibility
 Manipulating data with generic functions
 Accessing each piece of information via its
information path
 Gaining JSON serialization for free
After learning why and how to separate code from data in the previous chapter,
let’s talk about data on its own. In contrast to traditional OOP, where system design
tends to involve a rigid class hierarchy, DOP prescribes that we represent our data
model as a flexible combination of maps and arrays (or lists), where we can access
each piece of information via an information path. This chapter is a deep dive into
the second principle of DOP.
PRINCIPLE #2 Represent data entities with generic data structures.
