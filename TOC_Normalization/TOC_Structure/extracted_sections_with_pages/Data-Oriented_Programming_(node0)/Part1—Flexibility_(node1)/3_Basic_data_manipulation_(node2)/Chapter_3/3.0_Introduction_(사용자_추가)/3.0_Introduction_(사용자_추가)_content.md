Basic data manipulation
Meditation and programming
This chapter covers
 Representing records with string maps to improve
flexibility
 Manipulating data with generic functions
 Accessing each piece of information via its
information path
 Gaining JSON serialization for free
After learning why and how to separate code from data in the previous chapter,
let’s talk about data on its own. In contrast to traditional OOP, where system design
tends to involve a rigid class hierarchy, DOP prescribes that we represent our data
model as a flexible combination of maps and arrays (or lists), where we can access
each piece of information via an information path. This chapter is a deep dive into
the second principle of DOP.

44 CHAPTER 3 Basic data manipulation
We increase system flexibility when we represent records as string maps and not as
objects instantiated from classes. This liberates data from the rigidity of a class-based sys-
tem. Data becomes a first-class citizen powered by generic functions to add, remove, or
rename fields.
 NOTE We refer to maps that have strings as keys as string maps.
The dependency between the code that manipulates data and the data is a weak
dependency. The code only needs to know the keys of specific fields in the record it
wants to manipulate. The code doesn’t even need to know about all the keys in the
record, only the ones relevant to it. In this chapter, we’ll deal only with data query.
We’ll discuss managing changes in system state in the next chapter.
3.1 Designing a data model
During lunch at Simple, Theo and Joe don’t talk about programming. Instead, they start
getting to know each other on a personal level. Theo discovers that Joe is married to Kay,
who has just opened her creative therapy practice after many years of studying various
fields related to well-being. Neriah, their 14-year-old son, is passionate about drones, whereas
Aurelia, their 12-year-old daughter, plays the transverse flute.
Joe tells Theo that he’s been practicing meditation for 10 years. Meditation, he says, has
taught him how to break away from being continually lost in a “storm thought” (especially
negative thoughts, which can be the source of great suffering) to achieve a more direct
relationship with reality. The more he learns to experience reality as it is, the calmer his
mind. When he first started to practice meditation, it was sometimes difficult and even
weird, but by persevering, he has increased his feeling of well-being with each passing year.
When they’re back at the office, Joe tells Theo that his next step in their DOP journey
will be about data models. This includes data representation.
Joe When we design the data part of our system, we’re free to do it in isolation.
Theo What do you mean by isolation?
Joe I mean that you don’t have to bother with code, only data.
Theo Oh, right. I remember you telling me how that makes a DOP system simpler
than OOP. Separation of concerns is a design principle I’m used to in OOP.
Joe Indeed.
Theo And, when we think about data, the only relations we have to think about are
association and composition.
Joe Correct.
Theo Will the data model design be significantly different than the data model I’m
used to designing as an OOP developer?
Joe Not so much.
Theo OK. Let me see if I can draw a DOP-style data entity diagram.
Theo takes a look at the data mind map that he drew earlier in the morning. He then
draws the diagram in figure 3.1.
He refines the details of the fields of each data entity and the kind of relations between
entities. Figure 3.2 shows the result of this redefined data entity diagram.
