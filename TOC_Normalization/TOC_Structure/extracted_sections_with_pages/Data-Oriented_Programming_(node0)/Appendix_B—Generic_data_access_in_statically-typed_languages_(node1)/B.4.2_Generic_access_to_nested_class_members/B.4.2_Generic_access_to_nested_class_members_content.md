344 APPENDIX A Principles of data-oriented programming
class inheritance and composition. Therefore, the number of classes in the resulting
system will probably be somewhere between N and 2N.
On one hand, when adhering to Principle #1, the entities of the system are sim-
pler. On the other hand, there are more entities. This cost is mitigated by Principle
#2, which guides us to represent our data with generic data structures.
TIP When adhering to Principle #1, systems are made of simpler entities, but there
are more of them.
A.1.4 Summary of Principle #1
DOP requires the separation of code from data. In OOP languages, aggregate code in
static methods and data in classes with no methods. In FP languages, avoid hiding data
in the lexical scope of functions.
Separating code from data comes at a price. It reduces control over what pieces of
code access our data and can cause our systems to be made of more entities. But it’s
worth paying the price because, when adhering to this principle, our code can be
reused in different contexts in a straightforward way and tested in isolation. Moreover,
a system made of separate entities for code and data tends to be easier to understand.
DOP Principle #1: Separate code from data
To follow this principle, we separate code from data in such a way that the code
resides in functions whose behavior does not depend on data that is encapsulated
in the function’s context. The following diagram provides a visual representation
of this.

 Benefits include
– Code can be reused in different contexts.
– Code can be tested in isolation.
– Systems tend to be less complex.
 The cost for implementing Principle #1 includes
– No control on what code accesses which data.
– No packaging.
– More entities.

A.2 Principle #2: Represent data with generic data structures 345
A.2 Principle #2: Represent data with generic data
structures
When adhering to Principle #1, code is separated from data. DOP is not opinionated
about the programming constructs to use for organizing the code, but it has a lot to
say about how the data should be represented. This is the theme of Principle #2.
The most common generic data structures are maps (aka dictionaries) and arrays
(or lists). But other generic data structures (e.g., sets, trees, and queues) can be used
as well. Principle #2 does not deal with the mutability or the immutability of the data.
That is the theme of Principle #3.
PRINCIPLE #2 Represent application data with generic data structures.
A.2.1 Illustration of Principle #2
In DOP, data is represented with generic data structures (like maps and arrays)
instead of instantiating data via specific classes. In fact, most of the data entities that
appear in a typical application can be represented with maps and arrays (or lists). But
there exist other generic data structures (e.g., sets, lists, queues, etc.) that might be
required in some use cases. Let’s look at the same simple example we used to illustrate
Principle #1 (data that represents an author).
An author is a data entity with a firstName, a lastName, and the number of books
they have written. Principle #2 is broken when we use a specific class to represent an
author as this listing reveals.
ListingA.12 Breaking Principle #2 in OOP
class AuthorData {
constructor(firstName, lastName, books) {
this.firstName = firstName;
this.lastName = lastName;
this.books = books;
}
}
Principle #2 is followed when using a map (a dictionary or an associative array) as a
generic data structure that represents an author. The following listing illustrates how
we can follow this principle in OOP.
ListingA.13 Following Principle #2 in OOP
function createAuthorData(firstName, lastName, books) {
var data = new Map;
data.firstName = firstName;
data.lastName = lastName;
