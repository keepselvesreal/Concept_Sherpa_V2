}
}
var userData = new UserData("John", "Doe", "john@doe.com");
NameCalculation.fullName(userData);
var authorData = new AuthorData("Isaac", "Asimov", 500);
NameCalculation.fullName(authorData);
// → "John Doe"
TIP When code is separate from data, it is straightforward to reuse code in different
contexts. This benefit is achievable both in FP and in OOP.
BENEFIT #2: CODE CAN BE TESTED IN ISOLATION
A similar benefit is the ability to test code in an isolated context. When code is not sep-
arate from data, it is necessary to instantiate an object to test its methods. For instance,
in order to test the fullName code that lives inside the createAuthorObject function,
we need to instantiate an author object as the following listing shows.
ListingA.9 Testing code when code and data are mixed
var author = createAuthorObject("Isaac", "Asimov", 500);
author.fullName() === "Isaac Asimov"
// → true
In this simple scenario, it is not overly burdensome. We only load (unnecessarily) the
code for isProlific. Although in a real-world situation, instantiating an object might
involve complex and tedious setup.
In the DOP version, where createAuthorData and fullName are separate, we can
create the data to be passed to fullName in isolation, testing fullName in isolation as
well. The following listing provides an example.
ListingA.10 Testing code in isolation (FP style)
var author = {
firstName: "Isaac",
lastName: "Asimov"
};
fullName(author) === "Isaac Asimov"
// → true
If classes are used, it is only necessary to instantiate a data object. We do not need to
load the code for isProlific, which lives in a separate class than fullName, in order
to test fullName. The next listing lays out an example of this approach.
ListingA.11 Testing code in isolation (OOP style)
var data = new AuthorData("Isaac", "Asimov");
NameCalculation.fullName(data) === "Isaac Asimov"
// → true

A.1 Principle #1: Separate code from data 341
TIP Writing tests is easier when code is separated from data.
BENEFIT #3: SYSTEMS TEND TO BE LESS COMPLEX
The third benefit of applying Principle #1 to our programs is that systems tend to be less
complex. This benefit is the deepest one but also the one that is most subtle to explain.
The type of complexity I refer to is the one that makes systems hard to understand
as defined in the paper, “Out of the Tar Pit,” by Ben Moseley and Peter Marks (http://
mng.bz/enzq). It has nothing to do with the complexity of the resources consumed by
a program. Similarly, references to simplicity mean not complex (in other words, easy to
understand).
 NOTE Complex in the context of this book means hard to understand.
Keep in mind that complexity and simplicity (like hard and easy) are not absolute but
relative concepts. The complexity of two systems can be compared to determine
whether system A is more complex (or simpler) than system B. When code and data
are kept separate, the system tends to be easier to understand for two reasons:
 The scope of a data entity or a code entity is smaller than the scope of an entity that com-
bines code and data. Each entity is therefore easier to understand.
 Entities of the system are split into disjoint groups: code and data. Entities therefore
have fewer relations to other entities.
This insight is illustrated in a class diagram of our fictitious Library Management Sys-
tem, where code and data are mixed. It is not necessary to know the details of the
classes of this system to see that the diagram in figure A.2 represents a complex system;
