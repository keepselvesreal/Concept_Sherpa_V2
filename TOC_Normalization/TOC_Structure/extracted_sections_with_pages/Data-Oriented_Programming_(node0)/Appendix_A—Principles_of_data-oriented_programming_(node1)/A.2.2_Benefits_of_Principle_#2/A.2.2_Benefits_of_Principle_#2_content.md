15.4 Unit tests 323
Theo The code for the dataFilePath function that receives a context and returns a
file path is fairly simple. Check this out.
Listing15.15 Computing the file path for storing captured data
var capturedDataFolder = "test-data";
The root folder
function dataFilePath(context) {
for captured data
var uuid = generateUUID();
return capturedDataFolder
UUID generation is language-
+ "/" + context
dependent (see table 15.2).
+ "-" + ".json";
}
Uses json as a file extension
because we serialize data to JSON
Dave How do we store a piece of data in a JSON file?
Theo We serialize it and write it to disk.
Dave Synchronously or asynchronously?
Theo I prefer to write to the disk asynchronously or in a separate thread in run times
that support multithreading to avoid slowing down the real work. Here’s my
implementation of dumpData.
Listing15.16 Dumping data in JSON format
function dumpData(data, context) {
var path = dataFilePath(context); Writes asynchronously
to prevent blocking
var content = JSON.stringify(data);
the real work
fs.writeFile(path, content, function () {
The third argument is a
console.log("Data for " +
callback function, called
context +
when write completes.
"stored in: " +
path);
Displays a message once
});
data is written to the file
}
Dave Let me see if I can use dumpData inside Catalog.searchBooksByTitle and
capture the context to a file. I think that something like this should work.
Listing15.17 Capturing the context into a file
Catalog.searchBooksByTitle = function(catalogData, query) {
dumpData([catalogData, query], 'searchBooksByTitle');
var allBooks = _.get(catalogData, "booksByIsbn");
var queryLowerCased = query.toLowerCase();
var matchingBooks = _.filter(allBooks, function(book) {
return _.get(book, "title")
.toLowerCase()
.startsWith(queryLowerCased);
});
var bookInfos = _.map(matchingBooks, function(book) {
return Catalog.bookInfo(catalogData, book);
});

324 CHAPTER 15 Debugging
return bookInfos;
};
Theo Trigger the endpoint to see if it works.
Dave triggers the search endpoint once again and views the output in the console. When he
opens the file mentioned in the log message, he sees a single line that is hard to decipher.
Listing15.18 Console output when triggering the search endpoint
Data for searchBooksByTitle stored in
test-data/searchBooksByTitle-68e57c85-2213-471a-8442-c4516e83d786.json
Listing15.19 The content of the JSON file that captured the context
[{"booksByIsbn":{"978-1982137274":{"isbn":"978-1982137274",
"title":"7 Habits of Highly Effective People","authorIds":
["sean-covey","stephen-covey"]},"978-1779501127":{"isbn":
"978-1779501127","title":"Watchmen","publicationYear":1987,
"authorIds":["alan-moore","dave-gibbons"]}},"authorsById":
{"stephen-covey":{"name":"Stephen Covey","bookIsbns":
["978-1982137274"]},"sean-covey":{"name":"Sean Covey",
"bookIsbns":["978-1982137274"]},"dave-gibbons":
{"name":"Dave Gibbons","bookIsbns":["978-1779501127"]},
"alan-moore":{"name":"Alan Moore","bookIsbns":
["978-1779501127"]}}},"Habit"]
Dave Reading this JSON file is very difficult!
Theo We can beautify the JSON string if you want.
Dave How?
Theo By passing to JSON.stringify the number of space characters to use for
indentation. How many characters would you like to use for indentation?
Dave Two.
After adding the number of indentation characters to the code of dumpData, Dave then
opens the JSON file mentioned in the log message (it’s a different file name!). He now
sees a beautiful JSON array with two elements.
Listing15.20 Dumping data in JSON format with indentation
The second argument to
function dumpData(data, context) {
JSON.stringify is ignored.
var path = dataFilePath(context);
The third argument to
var content = JSON.stringify(data, null, 2);
JSON.stringify specifies the
number of characters to
use for indentation.
fs.writeFile(path, content, function () {
console.log("Data for " + context + "stored in: " + path);
});
}
