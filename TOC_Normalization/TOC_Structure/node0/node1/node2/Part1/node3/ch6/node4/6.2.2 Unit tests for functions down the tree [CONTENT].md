6.2.2 Unit tests for functions down the tree
Joe Let’s start from the function that appears in the deepest node in our tree:
Catalog.authorNames. Take a look at the code for Catalog.authorNames
and tell me what are the input and the output of Catalog.authorNames.
Joe turns his laptop so Theo can a closer look at the code. Theo takes a sip of his café au
lait as he looks over what’s on Joe’s laptop.
Listing6.5 The code of Catalog.authorNames
Catalog.authorNames = function (catalogData, authorIds) {
return _.map(authorIds, function(authorId) {
return _.get(catalogData, ["authorsById", authorId, "name"]);
});
Theo The input of Catalog.authorNames is catalogData and authorIds. The
output is authorNames.
Joe Would you do me a favor and express it visually?
Theo Sure.
It’s Theo’s turn to grab a napkin. He draws a small rectangle with two inward arrows and
one outward arrow as in figure 6.2.
catalogData authorIds
Catalog.authorNames()
Figure 6.2 Visualization of the input
authorNames and output of Catalog.authorNames
Joe Excellent! Now, how many combinations of input would you include in the
unit test for Catalog.authorNames?
Theo Let me see.
Theo reaches for another napkin. This time he creates a table to gather his thoughts
(table 6.1).
