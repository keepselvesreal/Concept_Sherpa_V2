1.2.4 Complex class hierarchies
One way to avoid writing the same code twice in OOP involves class inheritance. Indeed,
when every requirement of the system is known up front, you design your class hier-
archy is such a way that classes with common behavior derive from a base class.
Figure 1.15 shows an example of this pattern that focuses on the part of our class
diagram that deals with members and librarians. Both Librarians and Members need
the ability to log in, and they inherit this ability from the User class.
So far, so good, but when new requirements are introduced after the system is imple-
mented, it’s a completely different story. Fast forward to Monday, March 29th, at 11:00 AM,
where two days are left before the deadline (Wednesday at midnight).
