1.2.2 Unpredictable code behavior
You might be a bit tired after the system-level analysis that we presented in the previ-
ous section. Let’s get refreshed and look at some code.
Take a look at the code in listing 1.1, where we get the blocked status of a member
and display it twice. If I tell you that when I called displayBlockedStatusTwice, the
program displayed true on the first console.log call, can you tell me what the pro-
gram displayed on the second console.log call?
