1.2.3 Not trivial data serialization
Theo is really tired, and he falls asleep at his desk. He’s having dream. In his dream, Nancy
asks him to make Klafim’s Library Management System accessible via a REST API using
JSON as a transport layer. Theo has to implement a /search endpoint that receives a
query in JSON format and returns the results in JSON format. Listing 1.3 shows an input
example of the /search endpoint, and listing 1.4 shows an output example of the /search
endpoint.
Listing1.3 A JSON input of the /search endpoint
"searchCriteria": "author",
"query": "albert"
Listing1.4 A JSON output of the /search endpoint
"title": "The world as I see it",
"authors": [
"fullName": "Albert Einstein"
"title": "The Stranger",
"authors": [
"fullName": "Albert Camus"
