1.1.3 Explaining each piece of the class diagram
Dave Thanks for the UML refresher! Now I think I can remember what the different
arrows mean.
Theo My pleasure. Want to see how it all fits together?
Dave What class should we look at first?
Theo I think we should start with Library.
THE LIBRARY CLASS
The Library is the root class of the library system. Figure 1.6 shows the system structure.
CC Library
name : String
address : String
C Member
C Catalog
Bool isBlocked()
List<Book> search(searchCriteria, queryStr) Bool block()
BookItem addBookItem(librarian: Librarian, Bool unblock()
bookItem: BookItem) Bool returnBook(bookLending: BookLending)
BookLending checkout(bookItem: BookItem)
CC Librarian
Bool blockMember(member: Member)
Bool unblockMember(member: Member)
BookItem addBookItem(bookItem: BookItem)
List<BookLending> getBookLendingsOfMember
(member: Member)
Figure 1.6 The Library class
