1.2.1 Many relations between classes
One way to assess the complexity of a class diagram is to look only at the entities and

system, we have to define the relations between different pieces of code and data.
That’s unavoidable.

TIP In OOP, code and data are mixed together in classes: data as members and code as
methods.
