1.1.1 The design phase
Before rushing to his laptop to code the system, Theo grabs a sheet of paper, much big-
ger than a napkin, and starts to draw a UML class diagram of the system that will imple-
ment the Klafim prototype. Theo is an object-oriented programmer. For him, there is no
question—every business entity is represented by an object, and every object is made
from a class.
The requirements for the Klafim prototype
 There are two kinds of users: library members and librarians.
 Users log in to the system via email and password.
 Members can borrow books.
 Members and librarians can search books by title or by author.
 Librarians can block and unblock members (e.g., when they are late in return-
ing a book).
 Librarians can list the books currently lent to a member.
 There can be several copies of a book.
 A book belongs to a physical library.
Theo spends some time thinking about the organization of the system. He identifies the
main classes for the Klafim Global Library Management System.
