Summary
 Complexity in the context of this book means hard to understand.
 We use the terms code and behavior interchangeably.
 DOP stands for data-oriented programming.
 OOP stands for object-oriented programming.
 FP stands for functional programming.
 In a composition relation, when one object dies, the other one also dies.
 A composition relation is represented by a plain diamond at one edge and an
optional star at the other edge.
 In an association relation, each object has an independent life cycle.
 A many-to-many association relation is represented by an empty diamond and a
star at both edges.
 Dashed arrows indicate a usage relation; for instance, when a class uses a method
of another class.
 Plain arrows with empty triangles represent class inheritance, where the arrow
points towards the superclass.
 The design presented in this chapter doesn’t pretend to be the smartest OOP
design. Experienced OOP developers would probably use a couple of design
patterns and suggest a much better diagram.
