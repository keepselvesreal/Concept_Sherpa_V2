# Introduction

## 추출된 내용

My first a-ha moment came right in the introduction. In the first few pages, Yehona-
than explains that, though he’s written Clojure for 10 years, the book isn’t language-
specific, and the examples will be in JavaScript. Wait!—I thought. Could it really be
that I don’t have to change languages to deeply improve the way I write programs?
I was so excited by this prospect that I devoured the book in one sitting. My eyes
opened to something that had been right in front of me all along. Of course my code
was hard to test! Because of the ORM I used, all my functionality was written in objects
that assumed a bunch of database state! When I saw it spelled out with examples in the
book, I couldn’t unsee it. I didn’t need a new language, I just needed to approach pro-
gramming differently!
The designers I consider great all point to the same thing: good design is about
pulling things apart. It’s not just about getting the code to work, no matter how ugly.
