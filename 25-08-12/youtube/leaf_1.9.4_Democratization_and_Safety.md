### 1.9.4 Democratization and Safety

**Question**: But if we look at the numbers right, less than 0.5% of the world's population are software developers and software is an amazing way to scale ideas. So how do you think the products need to change to make it easier for people to vibe code and build software while also avoiding some of the things that we run into with people leaking API keys and things like that?

**Eric**: That's a really great question and I would be super excited to see more products and frameworks emerge that are kind of like provably correct. And maybe what I mean by that is I'm sure people could build some backend systems that the important auth parts, the payment parts are built for you and all you have to do is fill in the UI layer. And you know, you can vibe code that and it basically gives you some nice fill-in-the-blank sandboxes where to put your code.

I feel like there's tons of things like that that could exist. And maybe like the simplest example is like Claude artifacts where Claude can help you write code that gets hosted right there in Claude AI to display. And of course that is safe because it is very limited. There is no auth, there is no payments. It's front end only. But maybe that's a good product idea that someone should do here is build some way to make a provably correct hosting system that can have a backend that you know is safe no matter what shenanigans happens on the front end.

But yeah, I hope people build good tools that are complements to vibe coding.
