### 1.3.3 The Compiler Analogy

I think my favorite analogy here is like compilers. I'm sure in the early day of compilers, a lot of developers really didn't trust them. They might use a compiler, but they'd still read the assembly that it would output to make sure it looks, you know, how they would write the assembly. But that just doesn't scale. You know, at a certain point, you start needing to work on systems that are big enough that you just have to trust the system.
