### 1.8.1 Core Guidelines

So to leave you with the closing thoughts about how to vibe code in production responsibly. Be Claude's PM. Ask not what Claude can do for you, but what you can do for Claude. Focus your vibe coding on the leaf nodes, not the core architecture and underlying systems so that if there is tech debt, it's contained and it's not in important areas. Think about verifiability and how you can know whether this change is correct without needing to go read the code yourself. And finally, remember the exponential. It's okay today if you don't vibe code, but in a year or two, it's going to be a huge disadvantage if you yourself are demanding that you read every single line of code or write every single line of code. You're going to not be able to take advantage of the newest wave of models that are able to produce very large chunks of work for you. And you are going to become the bottleneck if we don't get good at this.
