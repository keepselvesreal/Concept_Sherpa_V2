## 1.0 Introduction

Hey everyone, welcome. I'm here to talk about everyone's favorite subject, vibe coding. And somewhat controversially, how to vibe code in production responsibly. So let's talk about vibe coding and what this even is.

First of all, I'm Eric. I'm a researcher at Anthropic focused on coding agents. I was the author along with Barry Zhang of building effective agents where we outlined our best science and best practices for creating agents no matter what the application is. This is a subject that's near and dear to my heart. Last year I actually broke my hand while biking to work and was in a cast for two months and Claude wrote all of my code for those two months. And so figuring out how to make this happen effectively was really important to me and I was luckily able to figure that out well and sort of help bring that into a lot of Anthropic's other products and in our models through my research.
