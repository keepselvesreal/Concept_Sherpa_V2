### 1.9.1 Learning and Skill Development

**Question**: In the past we spent a lot of time dealing with syntax problems or libraries or connections amongst components of the code and that was how we learn by coding like that. But how do we learn now? How do we become better coders? How do we know more to become better product managers of the agent AI?

**Eric**: Yeah, so I think this is a really interesting question and I think there are reasons to be very worried about this and also reasons to be very optimistic about this. I think the reason to be worried like you mentioned is that we are not going to be there in the struggle, in the grind.

I think that is actually okay. I've met some of my professors in college would say like "ah man like coders today aren't as good because they never had to write their assembly by hand. They don't really feel the pain of how to make something run really fast."

I think the positive side of this is that I have found that I'm able to learn about things so much more quickly by using these AI tools. A lot of times when I am coding with Claude I'll be reviewing the code and I'll say "hey Claude I've never seen this library before. Tell me about it. What is it? Why did you choose it over another?" And having that always there pair programmer.

I think what's going to change is that people that are lazy are not going to learn. They're just going to glide by. But if you take the time and you want to learn, there's all these amazing resources and Claude will help you understand what it vibe coded for you.

The other thing I will say is that for learning some of these higher level things about what makes a project go well, what is a feature that gets you product market fit versus flops, we're going to be able to take so many more shots on goal. I feel like especially system engineers or architects, it takes oftentimes like two years to make a big change in a codebase and really come to terms with was that a good architecture decision or not. And if we can collapse that time down to 6 months, I think engineers that are investing in their own time and trying to learn, they're going to be able to learn from four times as many lessons in the same amount of calendar time as long as they're putting in the effort to trying.
