### 1.6.2 Preparation and Context Building

And I think that as we vibe code, that becomes our responsibility to feed that information into Claude to make sure that it has all of that same context and is set up to succeed. When I'm working on features with Claude, I often spend 15 or 20 minutes collecting guidance into a single prompt and then let Claude cook after that.

And that 15 or 20 minutes isn't just me writing the prompt by hand. This is often a separate conversation where I'm talking back and forth with Claude. It's exploring the codebase. It's looking for files. We're building a plan together that captures the essence of what I want, what files are going to need to be changed, what patterns in the codebase should it follow.

And once I have that artifact, that all of that information, then I give it to Claude, either in a new context or say, "Hey, let's go execute this plan." And I've typically seen once I put that effort into collecting all that information, Claude has a very, very high success rate of being able to complete something in a very good way.
