### 1.4.1 Core Philosophy

The question though is how do you do that responsibly? And I think my challenge to the whole software industry over the next few years is how will we vibe code in production and do it safely? And my answer to that is that we will forget that the code exists but not that the product exists.

Thinking again to that compiler analogy, you know, we all still know that there's assembly under the hood, but hopefully most of us don't need to really think about what the assembly actually is. But we still are able to build good software without understanding that assembly under the hood. And I think that we will get to that same level with software.
