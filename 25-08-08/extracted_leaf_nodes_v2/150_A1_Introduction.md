Figure A.1 The principles of DOP
Notice that DOP principles are language-agnostic. They can be adhered to (or bro-
ken) in
 Object-oriented programming (OOP) languages such as Java, C#, C++, etc.
 Functional programming (FP) languages such as Clojure, OCaml, Haskell, etc.
 Languages that support both OOP and FP such as JavaScript, Python, Ruby,
Scala, etc.
TIP DOP principles are language-agnostic.
 NOTE For OOP developers, the transition to DOP might require more of a mind
shift than for FP developers because DOP prohibits the encapsulation of data in state-
ful classes.
This appendix succinctly illustrates how these principles can be applied or broken in
JavaScript. Mentioned briefly are the benefits of adherence to each principle, and the
costs paid to enjoy those benefits. This appendix also illustrates the principles of DOP
via simple code snippets. Throughout the book, the application of DOP principles to
production information systems is explored in depth.

A.1 Principle #1: Separate code from data 335
A.1 Principle #1: Separate code from data
Principle #1 is a design principle that recommends a clear separation between code
(behavior) and data. This may appear to be a FP principle, but in fact, one can adhere
to it or break it either in FP or in OOP:
 Adherence to this principle in OOP means aggregating the code as methods of
a static class.
 Breaking this principle in FP means hiding state in the lexical scope of a function.
Also, this principle does not relate to the way data is represented. Data representation
is addressed by Principle #2.
PRINCIPLE #1 Separate code from data in a way that the code resides in functions
whose behavior does not depend on data that is encapsulated in the function’s
context.
A.1.1 Illustration of Principle #1
Our exploration of Principle #1 begins by illustrating how it can be applied to OOP
and FP. The following sections illustrate how this principle can be adhered to or bro-
ken in a simple program that deals with:
 An author entity with a firstName, a lastName, and the number of books they
wrote.
 A piece of code that calculates the full name of the author.
 A piece of code that determines if an author is prolific, based on the number of
books they wrote.
BREAKING PRINCIPLE #1 IN OOP
Breaking Principle #1 in OOP happens when we write code that combines data and
code together in an object. The following listing demonstrates what this looks like.
ListingA.1 Breaking Principle #1 in OOP
class Author {
constructor(firstName, lastName, books) {
this.firstName = firstName;
this.lastName = lastName;
this.books = books;
}
fullName() {
return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
}
isProlific() {
return this.books > 100;
}
}

336 APPENDIX A Principles of data-oriented programming
var obj = new Author("Isaac", "Asimov", 500);
Isaac Asimov really
obj.fullName();
wrote around 500
// → "Isaac Asimov" books!
BREAKING PRINCIPLE #1 IN FP
Breaking this principle without classes in FP means hiding data in the lexical scope of
a function. The next listing provides an example of this.
ListingA.2 Breaking Principle #1 in FP
function createAuthorObject(firstName, lastName, books) {
return {
fullName: function() {
return firstName + " " + lastName;
},
isProlific: function () {
return books > 100;
}
};
}
var obj = createAuthorObject("Isaac", "Asimov", 500);
obj.fullName();
// → "Isaac Asimov"
ADHERING TO PRINCIPLE #1 IN OOP
Listing A.3 shows an example that adheres to Principle #1 in OOP. Compliance with
this principle may be achieved even with classes by writing programs such that:
 The code consists of static methods.
 The data is encapsulated in data classes (classes that are merely containers of
data).
ListingA.3 Following Principle #1 in OOP
class AuthorData {
constructor(firstName, lastName, books) {
this.firstName = firstName;
this.lastName = lastName;
this.books = books;
}
}
class NameCalculation {
static fullName(data) {
return data.firstName + " " + data.lastName;
}
}
class AuthorRating {
static isProlific (data) {
return data.books > 100;
}
}

=== Page 365 ===
A.1 Principle #1: Separate code from data 337
var data = new AuthorData("Isaac", "Asimov", 500);
NameCalculation.fullName(data);
// → "Isaac Asimov"
ADHERING TO PRINCIPLE #1 IN FP
Listing A.4 shows an example that adheres to Principle #1 in FP. Compliance with this
principle means separating code from data.
ListingA.4 Following Principle #1 in FP
function createAuthorData(firstName, lastName, books) {
return {
firstName: firstName,
lastName: lastName,
books: books
};
}
function fullName(data) {
return data.firstName + " " + data.lastName;
}
function isProlific (data) {
return data.books > 100;
}
var data = createAuthorData("Isaac", "Asimov", 500);
fullName(data);
// → "Isaac Asimov"
A.1.2 Benefits of Principle #1
Having illustrated how to follow or break Principle #1 both in OOP and FP, let’s look
at the benefits that Principle #1 brings to our programs. Careful separation of code
from data benefits our programs in the following ways:
 Code can be reused in different contexts.
 Code can be tested in isolation.
 Systems tend to be less complex.
BENEFIT #1: CODE CAN BE REUSED IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS
Imagine that besides the author entity, there is a user entity that has nothing to do
with authors but has two of the same data fields as the author entity: firstName and
lastName. The logic of calculating the full name is the same for authors and users—
retrieving the values of two fields with the same names. However, in traditional OOP
as in the version with createAuthorObject in listing A.5, the code of fullName cannot
be reused on a user in a straightforward way because it is locked inside the Author class.
ListingA.5 The code of fullName is locked in the Author class
class Author {
constructor(firstName, lastName, books) {
