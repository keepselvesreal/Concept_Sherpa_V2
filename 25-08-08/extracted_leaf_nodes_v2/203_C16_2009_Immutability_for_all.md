tability for all
Clojure’s efficient implementation of persistent data structures has been attractive for
developers from other programming languages. In 2009, these structures were ported
to Scala. Over the years, they have been ported to other programming languages as
well, either by organizations like Facebook for Immutable.js, or by individual contrib-
utors like Glen Peterson for Paguro in Java. Nowadays, DOP is applicable in virtually
any programming language!
