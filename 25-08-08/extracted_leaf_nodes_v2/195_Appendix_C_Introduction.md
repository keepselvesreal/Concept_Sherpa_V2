oriented programming:
A link in the chain of
programming paradigms
Data-oriented programming (DOP) has its origins in the 1950s with the invention
of the programming language Lisp. DOP is based on a set of best practices that can
be found in both functional programming (FP) and object-oriented programming
(OOP). However, this paradigm has only been applicable in production systems at
scale since the 2010s with the implementation of efficient persistent data struc-
tures. This appendix traces the major ideas and discoveries which, over the years,
have led to the emergence of DOP (see figure C.1).
