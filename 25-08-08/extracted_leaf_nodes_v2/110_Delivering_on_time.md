Joe was right! Theo recalls Joe’s story about the young woodcutter and the old man. Theo
was able to learn DOP and deliver the project on time! He’s pleased that he took the time
“to sharpen his saw and commit to a deeper level of practice.”
 NOTE If you are unable to recall the story or if you missed it, check out the opener
to part 2.
The Klafim project is a success. Nancy is pleased. Theo’s boss is satisfied. Theo got pro-
moted. What more can a person ask for?
Theo remembers his deal with Joe. As he strolls through the stores of the Westfield San
Francisco Center to look for a gift for each of Joe’s children, Neriah and Aurelia, he is
filled with a sense of purpose and great pleasure. He buys a DJI Mavic Air 2 drone for Ner-
iah, and the latest Apple Airpod Pros for Aurelia. He also takes this opportunity to buy a
necklace and a pair of earrings for his wife, Jane. It’s a way for him to thank her for having
endured his long days at work since the beginning of the Klafim project.
 NOTE The story continues in the opener of part 3.
