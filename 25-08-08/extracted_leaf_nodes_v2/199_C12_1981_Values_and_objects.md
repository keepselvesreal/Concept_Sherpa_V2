es and objects
In a short and easy-to-read paper, named “Values and Objects in Programming Lan-
guages,” Bruce MacLennan clarifies the distinction between values and objects. In a
nutshell,
 Values (for instance, numbers) are timeless abstractions for which the concepts
of updating, sharing, and instantiation have no meaning.
 Objects (for instance, an employee object in a human resource software system)
exist in time and, hence, can be created, destroyed, copied, shared, and updated.
 NOTE The meaning of the term object in this paper is not exactly the same as in the
context of OOP.
The author explains why it’s much simpler to write code that deals with values than to
write code that deals with objects. This paper has been a source of inspiration for DOP
as it encourages us to implement our systems in such a way that most of our code deals
with values. You can read the full text of this paper at http://mng.bz/7WNy.
