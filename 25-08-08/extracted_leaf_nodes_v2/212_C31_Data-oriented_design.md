ted design
Data-oriented design is a program optimization approach motivated by efficient usage
of the CPU cache. It’s used mostly in video game development. This approach focuses
on the data layout, separating and sorting fields according to when they are needed,
and encourages us to think about data transformations. In this context, what’s import-
ant is how the data resides in memory. The objective of this paradigm is to improve
the performance of the system.
