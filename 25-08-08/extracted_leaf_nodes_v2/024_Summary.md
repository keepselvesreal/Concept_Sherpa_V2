rinciples are language-agnostic.
 DOP principle #1 is to separate code from data.
 The separation between code and data in DOP systems makes them simpler
(easier to understand) than traditional OOP systems.
 Data entities are the parts of your system that hold information.
 DOP is against data encapsulation.
 The more flexible a system is, the easier it is to adapt to changing requirements.
 The separation between code and data in DOP systems makes them more flexi-
ble than traditional OOP systems.
 When code is separated from data, we have the freedom to design code and
data in isolation.
 We represent data as data entities.
 We discover the data entities of our system and sort them into high-level groups,
either as a nested list or as a mind map.
 A DOP system is easier to understand than a traditional OOP system because
the system is split into two parts: data entities and code modules.
 In DOP, a code module is an aggregation of stateless functions.
 DOP systems are flexible. Quite often they adapt to changing requirements
without changing the system design.
 In traditional OOP, the state of the object is an implicit argument to the meth-
ods of the object.
 Stateless functions receive data they manipulate as an explicit argument.
 The high-level modules of a DOP system correspond to high-level data entities.
 The only kind of relation between code modules is the usage relation.
 The only kinds of relation between data entities are the association and the compo-
sition relation.
 For a discussion of polymorphism in DOP, see chapter 13.
