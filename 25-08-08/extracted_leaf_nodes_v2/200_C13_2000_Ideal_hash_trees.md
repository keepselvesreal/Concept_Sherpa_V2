l hash trees
Phil Bagwell invented a data structure called Hash Array Mapped Trie (HAMT). In his
paper, “Ideal Hash Trees,” he used HAMT to implement hash maps with nearly ideal
characteristics both in terms of computation and memory usage. As we illustrated in
chapter 9, HAMT and ideal hash trees are the foundation of efficient persistent data
structures. See https://lampwww.epfl.ch/papers/idealhashtrees.pdf to read his tech-
nical paper.
