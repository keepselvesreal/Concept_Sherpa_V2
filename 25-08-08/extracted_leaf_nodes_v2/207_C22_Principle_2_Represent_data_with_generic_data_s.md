#2: Represent data with generic data structures
One of the main innovations of JavaScript when it was released in December 1995
was the ease of creating and manipulating hash maps via object literals. The increas-
ing popularity of JavaScript over the years as a language used everywhere (frontend,
backend, and desktop) has influenced the developer community to represent data
with hash maps when possible. It feels more natural in dynamically-typed program-
ming languages, but as we saw in appendix B, it is applicable also in statically-typed
programming languages.
