he meeting with Nancy went well. Albatross got the deal, Monica (Theo’s boss) is
pleased, and it’s going to be a long-term project with a nice budget. They’ll need to hire a
team of developers in order to meet the tough deadlines. While driving back to the office,
Theo gets a phone call from Joe.
Joe How was your meeting with Nancy?
Theo We got the deal!
Joe Awesome! I told you that with DOP the cost estimation would be lower.
Theo In fact, we are not going to use DOP for this project.
Joe Why?
Theo After refactoring the Library Management System prototype to DOP, I did a
deep analysis with my engineers. We came to the conclusion that DOP might
be a good fit for the prototype phase, but it won’t work well at scale.
Joe Could you share the details of your analysis?
Theo I can’t right now. I’m driving.
Joe Could we meet in your office later today?
Theo I’m quite busy with the new project and the tough deadlines.
Joe Let’s meet at least in order to have a proper farewell.
Theo OK. Let’s meet at 4 PM, then.
 NOTE The story continues in the opener of part 2.
