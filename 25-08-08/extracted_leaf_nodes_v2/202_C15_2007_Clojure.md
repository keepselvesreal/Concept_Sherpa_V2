Rich Hickey, an OOP expert, invented Clojure to make it easier to develop informa-
tion systems at scale. Rich Hickey likes to summarize Clojure’s core value with the
phrase, “Just use maps!” By maps, he means immutable maps to be manipulated effi-
ciently by generic functions. Those maps were implemented using the data structures
presented by Phil Bagwell in his paper, “Ideal Hash Trees.”
Clojure has been the main source of inspiration for DOP. In a sense, this book is a
formalization of the underlying principles of Clojure and how to apply them in other
programming languages.
