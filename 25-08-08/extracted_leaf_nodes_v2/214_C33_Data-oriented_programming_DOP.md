ted programming (DOP)
As we have illustrated in this book, DOP is a paradigm that treats system data as a first-
class citizen. Data is represented by generic immutable data structures like maps and
vectors that are manipulated by general-purpose functions like map, filter, select, group,
sort, and so forth. In this context, what’s important is the representation of data by the
program. The objective of this paradigm is to reduce the complexity of the system.
