after the meeting with Dave at the museum, Theo invites Joe and Nancy for his
farewell party at Albatross. This is the first time that Joe meets Nancy, and Theo takes the
opportunity to tell Nancy that if the Klafim project met its deadlines, it was thanks to Joe.
Everyone is curious about the name of the company Theo is going to work for, but no one
dares to ask him. Finally, it’s Dave who gets up the courage to ask.
Dave May I ask you what company are you going to work for?
Theo I’m going to take a break.
