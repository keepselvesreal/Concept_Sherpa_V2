Data-driven programming is the idea that you create domain specific languages (DSLs)
made out of descriptive data. It is a branch of declarative programming. In this context,
what’s important is to describe the behavior of a program in terms of data. The objective
of this paradigm is to increase code clarity and to reduce the risk of bugs related to mis-
takes in the implementation of the expected behavior of the program.
