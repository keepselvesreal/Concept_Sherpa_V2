of the Tar Pit
In their paper, “Out of the Tar Pit,” Ben Moseley and Peter Marks claim that complex-
ity is the single major difficulty in the development of large-scale software systems. In
the context of their paper, complexity means “that which makes large systems hard to
understand.”
The main insight of the authors is that most of the complexity of software systems
in not essential but accidental: the complexity doesn’t come from the problem we
have to solve but from the software constructs we use to solve the problem. They sug-
gest various ways to reduce complexity of software systems.
In a sense, DOP is a way to get us out of the tar pit. See http://mng.bz/mxq2 to
