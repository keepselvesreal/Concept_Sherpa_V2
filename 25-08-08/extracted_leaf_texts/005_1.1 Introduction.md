1.1 OOP design: Classic or classical?
 NOTE Theo, Nancy, and their new project were introduced in the opener for part 1.
Take a moment to read the opener if you missed it.
Theo gets back to the office with Nancy’s napkin in his pocket and a lot of anxiety in his
heart because he knows he has committed to a tough deadline. But he had no choice! Last
week, Monica, his boss, told him quite clearly that he had to close the deal with Nancy no
matter what.
Albatross, where Theo works, is a software consulting company with customers all over
the world. It originally had lots of customers among startups. Over the last year, however,
many projects were badly managed, and the Startup department lost the trust of its cus-
tomers. That’s why management moved Theo from the Enterprise department to the
Startup department as a Senior Tech lead. His job is to close deals and to deliver on time.
