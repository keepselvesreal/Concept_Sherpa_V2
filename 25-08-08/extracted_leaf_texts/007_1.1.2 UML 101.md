1.1.2 UML 101
Latte in hand, Dave follows Theo to his desk. Theo proudly shows Dave his piece of art: the
UML diagram for the Library Management System (figure 1.1). Dave seems really excited.
Dave Wow! Such a detailed class diagram.
Theo Yeah. I’m pretty happy with it.

Dave The thing is that I can never remember the meaning of the different arrows.
Theo There are four types of arrows in my class diagram: composition, association,
inheritance, and usage.
Dave What’s the difference between composition and association?
 NOTE Don’t worry if you’re not familiar with OOP jargon. We’re going to leave it
aside in the next chapter.
Theo It’s all about whether the objects can live without each other. With composi-
tion, when one object dies, the other one dies too. While in an association rela-
tion, each object has an independent life.
TIP In a composition relation, when one object dies, the other one also dies. While
in an association relation, each object has an independent life cycle.
In the class diagram, there are two kinds of composition symbolized by an arrow with
a plain diamond at one edge and an optional star at the other edge. Figure 1.2 shows
the relation between:
 A Library that owns a Catalog—A one-to-one composition. If a Library object
dies, then its Catalog object dies with it.
 A Library that owns many Members—A one-to-many composition. If a Library
object dies, then all its Member objects die with it.
C Library
name : String * C Member
address : String
Figure 1.2 The two kinds of
C Catalog composition: one-to-one and
one-to-many. In both cases,
List<Book> search(searchCriteria, queryStr) when an object dies, the
BookItem addBookItem(librarian: Librarian, bookItem: BookItem)
composed object dies with it.
TIP A composition relation is represented by a plain diamond at one edge and an
optional star at the other edge.
Dave Do you have association relations in your diagram?
Theo Take a look at the arrow between Book and Author. It has an empty diamond
and a star at both edges, so it’s a many-to-many association relation.
A book can be written by multiple authors, and an author can write multiple books.
Moreover, Book and Author objects can live independently. The relation between
books and authors is a many-to-many association (figure 1.3).

each object lives independently.
TIP A many-to-many association relation is represented by an empty diamond and a
star at both edges.
Dave I also see a bunch of dashed arrows in your diagram.
Theo Dashed arrows are for usage relations: when a class uses a method of another
class. Consider, for example, the Librarian::blockMember method. It calls
Member::block.
TIP Dashed arrows indicate usage relations (figure 1.4), for instance, when a class
uses a method of another class.
CC Librarian
Bool blockMember(member: Member)
Bool unblockMember(member: Member)
BookItem addBookItem(bookItem: BookItem)
List<BookLending> getBookLendingsOfMember(member: Member)
C Member
Bool isBlocked()
Bool block()
Bool unblock()
Bool returnBook(bookLending: BookLending) Figure 1.4 Usage relation: a class
BookLending checkout(bookItem: BookItem) uses a method of another class.
Dave I see. And I guess a plain arrow with an empty triangle, like the one between
Member and User, represents inheritance.
Theo Absolutely!
TIP Plain arrows with empty triangles represent class inheritance (figure 1.5), where
the arrow points towards the superclass.
