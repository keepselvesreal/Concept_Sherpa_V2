[00:00] engineers. Here we have six cloud code
[00:04] instances. In each instance we have six
[00:07] unique output styles. Default table
[00:10] format, YAML format, ultra concise
[00:14] format, texttospech summary, and most
[00:17] importantly, HTML format. For every
[00:20] agent with every style, we have one
[00:23] prompt.
[00:25] Honestly, when I first saw the output
[00:28] styles feature drop, my first thought
[00:31] was, "This is useless." But I never let
[00:34] my initial reaction prevent me from
[00:36] doing the real work and understanding
[00:39] the feature. After a quick dev session,
[00:41] I learned just how useful these output
[00:44] styles are. Never bet on your first
[00:48] initial reaction without doing the work.
[00:50] Dan, I've explained how to add new hooks
[00:53] to your cloud code setup with examples
[00:55] and configuration steps.
[00:57] So, you can hear our text to speech
[00:59] format summarize the exact work that was
[01:03] completed. We can see our results
[01:04] starting to flow in here. We're going to
[01:06] break down every one of these output
[01:08] formats. Believe it or not, this feature
[01:10] release marks the beginning of viable
[01:13] generative UI. The Claudeco team is on a
[01:16] generational hot streak, shipping
[01:19] valuable features backto back to back.
[01:23] But there are two features I'm not a fan
[01:26] of because they could take the tool in
[01:29] the complete wrong direction. We'll talk
[01:31] about that in this video. Right next to
[01:33] the output styles drop, we also have the
[01:36] status line feature that lets you
[01:38] customize your claw code interface. And
[01:40] I can guarantee you, you're not using
[01:43] this feature to its full potential yet
[01:51] [Music]
[01:57] default table YAML ultra concise text to
[02:01] speech HTML. New features are only
[02:04] valuable in relation to existing
[02:06] features. In our first cloud code
[02:08] instance, you can see the default
[02:09] response for the following prompt. We
[02:12] asked /quest, how can I add a new hook?
[02:15] If we look at this response format, you
[02:17] can see it's the default cloud code
[02:19] response format, but now we have full
[02:21] control over the output style of cloud
[02:24] code. If we switch to our table output
[02:27] format, you can see something very
[02:29] different. We have clean formatted
[02:31] tables helping us speed up the flow of
[02:34] information between us and our agents.
[02:37] You can see this is a valuable format
[02:39] for organizing information. Now we get
[02:41] to my second favorite output format,
[02:44] YAML. At first, this format might seem
[02:47] uh kind of weird and kind of out of
[02:49] place, but the YAML output format
[02:52] actually has a really interesting way of
[02:54] organizing information in a highly
[02:57] structured way. I found that this
[02:58] specific cloud code instance typically
[03:01] outperforms the rest. Why might that be?
[03:03] If I just copy all this out here, clean
[03:05] up the output format a little bit here.
[03:08] So, you can see the task here, analyze
[03:09] the hook system, provide guidance on
[03:11] adding new hooks, status complete.
[03:13] There's some details. The YAML format
[03:16] provides a highly structuredformational
[03:18] way to get responses out of your cloud
[03:21] code instances. So, next up, we have the
[03:24] ultra concise format. This format is the
[03:27] most similar to the default cloud code
[03:29] response, but it's going to be concise
[03:31] and just give you enough information.
[03:33] I've also found that the ultra concise
[03:35] response format reduces the number of
[03:38] input and output tokens that cloud code
[03:40] consumes. Next, the texttospech format.
[03:44] In the beginning, you heard after our
[03:46] agent completed its work, it
[03:48] communicated exactly what it's done.
[03:50] I'll just run this again. Say again.
[03:52] Okay, so we can just hear that again.
[03:54] I've explained how to add new hooks to
[03:55] your cloud code setup with examples and
[03:57] configuration steps. Audio summary again
[03:59] for Dan about claude code hooks setup
[04:01] and configuration.
[04:03] Okay, so you know in the system prompt
[04:06] it has the instructions. Whatever
[04:07] command you just ran, summarize it. So I
[04:09] asked it to run that audio summary
[04:11] again. It ran it and then it ran an
[04:13] audio summary on the audio summary.
[04:16] Okay, so that's fantastic. But there is
[04:18] one output format that is more important
[04:22] than all of them. We have the HTML
[04:25] format. This is the most important
[04:28] output format of them all. Let me
[04:30] explain why.
[04:35] This is the one output format to rule
[04:38] them all. At first, you might be
[04:39] thinking, Dan, this is stupid. This is
[04:41] super hard to read. There's no way I'm
[04:44] going to actually get information by
[04:46] reading HTML. You know, we're talking 10
[04:49] to hundreds of responses per day as
[04:51] we're doing real engineering work with
[04:53] cloud code with agent coding tools.
[04:55] Let's slow down and really think about
[04:58] what's happening here. We have dynamic
[05:00] accurate HTML generation our agent is
[05:04] generating on the fly. What you're
[05:06] looking at here is the first useful
[05:09] application of generative UI. With a few
[05:13] tweaks to this prompt, we can create a
[05:16] new output style that enhances the
[05:18] information rate between us and our
[05:21] agent. Let me show you exactly what I
[05:22] mean. Let's fire up a brand new cloud
[05:24] code instance /output style to update
[05:27] the style. And then we're going to hit
[05:29] genui. What you just saw was format 8.
[05:32] This our HTML structure. This prompt
[05:35] builds on top of the HTML layer. Let's
[05:37] fire this off and let's run that exact
[05:40] same prompt that we ran before. Okay.
[05:42] slashquest, how can I add a new hook?
[05:45] And what you're going to see here is
[05:47] nothing short of extraordinary. With
[05:50] output styles, with claw code, our agent
[05:53] can build UI on the fly. Now, I'll
[05:57] create a comprehensive HTML guide
[05:59] explaining how to add a new hook to claw
[06:02] code. On every response, our agent is
[06:05] going to generate UI and respond to us
[06:08] in this rich way. Okay, check this out.
[06:12] How to add a new claw code hook. Okay,
[06:15] let's let's, you know, see exactly what
[06:16] happened there. It wrote to a temporary
[06:18] file. It opened it at the end of the
[06:21] response and it generated an HTML guide
[06:24] for us. This is generative UI. This is
[06:27] not a gimmick.
[06:30] This is yet another powerful agent
[06:32] decoding tool, a powerful agent decoding
[06:34] pattern you now have in your toolbox.
[06:37] Okay. With every request, we can now
[06:40] have our agent generate UI for us. This
[06:43] is generative UI. And you can see here
[06:46] we got a great breakdown on exactly how
[06:48] to add this. It's got consistent simple
[06:51] themes and styles. This is insane,
[06:53] right? And then we have project
[06:54] structure, right? It's really breaking
[06:55] down how we can add a cloud code hook.
[06:58] We even have some next steps. We have
[07:00] files referenced. Here we have UI that
[07:03] was generated on the fly for us. This is
[07:06] HTML. It's the language of UI and of
[07:09] course sonnet opus they can generate
[07:12] this for us with no problem. Okay, it
[07:15] does take a little more time to generate
[07:17] the response but you can see how
[07:18] powerful this can be. Okay, this is not
[07:20] a gimmick, right? Let's let's run some
[07:22] more of these. Output style genui
[07:27] output style genui. Here we're going to
[07:29] generate a typescript interface. Here
[07:32] we're going to do some research with
[07:33] firecrawl. We want to see the top five
[07:35] hacker news posts. break down the
[07:36] sentiment. I'm going to update the model
[07:38] here. Switch to opus and this is going
[07:40] to be in that YAML format. Create a
[07:42] pyantic class for claw code hook output
[07:44] structure blah blah blah. All right, so
[07:45] we're going to run that. Now we have
[07:47] multiple agents running on our behalf
[07:49] getting work done for us. All right, so
[07:52] check this out. Here's our hacker news
[07:54] sentiment analysis. We can quickly
[07:56] validate this. The future of large files
[07:58] in git is git. If we just search this,
[08:00] you can see there's that 453 points.
[08:02] That looks right. This is quite
[08:04] fascinating. Okay, there's a new
[08:06] paradigm to operate in. You can see the
[08:07] points on the side there. We are getting
[08:09] the top five posts on hacker news right
[08:12] now of this date. We have a temp file
[08:14] getting generated for us on the fly.
[08:16] Here's another one. We have that
[08:18] typescript interface get generated.
[08:20] Here's a summary of the work done. Task
[08:21] completed. It created this new types
[08:23] file for us based on the JSON structure
[08:26] in this file. Clean simple write up,
[08:28] right? Detailing exactly what was done.
[08:31] Preconfigured variables. You can see
[08:33] here's the interface hierarchy just
[08:35] giving us a breakdown of what this looks
[08:36] like. We can of course open up this
[08:38] codebase. Just search for types, you
[08:40] know, there it is. If we look MCP JSON
[08:43] sample, this exact type right here. And
[08:46] it looks like it's typed it out nicely
[08:48] for us here based on the other MCP
[08:50] servers it has in its system prompt. And
[08:53] here's our last request here wrapping up
[08:56] CC generate cloud code hook models. So
[08:58] based on all the output types from our
[09:01] hooks, look at this incredible UI,
[09:04] right? Every time it runs, it's
[09:06] generating UI for us. You can imagine
[09:08] pushing this further, adding a layer on
[09:10] top of this where we can interact back
[09:14] and forth. You can imagine a layer where
[09:16] cloud code itself, the terminal
[09:18] interface, is actually presenting us
[09:21] with generated terminal user interfaces
[09:24] and letting us interact with that.
[09:26] Right? There are really no limits to to
[09:28] this capability, right? We have truly
[09:30] the first useful application of
[09:33] generative UI, right? Us interacting
[09:35] with our agents, our agents giving us
[09:37] specific responses. You can see here
[09:39] it's breaking down all the hooks. This
[09:41] is all based on our output style system
[09:44] prompt. Okay, this feature is ultra
[09:47] ultra powerful. I'm almost like
[09:49] embarrassed to say that I thought this
[09:51] was not useful, right? that this is
[09:54] ultra powerful and I think that probably
[09:56] even the cloud code engineers haven't
[09:58] really realized um this capability right
[10:01] or where this could go they have now
[10:03] because they're watching this video
[10:05] what's up anthropic engineers cloud code
[10:07] engineers thank you you guys are doing
[10:08] incredible work here but this is really
[10:11] extraordinary right this is the power of
[10:13] the primitive that is cloud code this is
[10:16] the power of stacking up the right
[10:19] feature set putting together the right
[10:21] tools and most importantly understanding
[10:23] the fundamentals of AI coding and what's
[10:25] actually happening under the hood of the
[10:27] agent, right? All this does is it
[10:30] updates the prompt, right? The output
[10:31] style, they say it here, right? I'm
[10:33] really happy that they're being really
[10:35] clear about the fundamental unit that
[10:37] this is updating. The output styles
[10:39] update the system prompt. Okay, as
[10:41] viewers of the channel know, there are
[10:43] only three key elements of every agentic
[10:46] system. Context, model, prompt. If you
[10:49] master these, if you understand these,
[10:51] you can move from tool to tool to tool
[10:54] to idea to idea to idea at light speed
[10:57] because everything is built on this.
[10:59] This is a principle of AI coding. Okay?
[11:03] Principle of the generative AI age. When
[11:06] you combine this with some tools, you
[11:08] get some really extraordinary things. I
[11:09] don't need to reread the docs to you.
[11:11] You get the point, right? When you see
[11:13] the tech YouTube ecosystem or the
[11:15] Twitter bros or some blog
[11:17] use claw code output styles uh to
[11:22] generate UI, remember where you saw this
[11:24] first. Okay, remember how many things
[11:26] you've seen first here, right? It's it's
[11:28] all it's so obvious after you've seen
[11:30] it. I've seen so much of what we've done
[11:33] here on the channel getting repurposed
[11:35] uh without giving credit where it's due.
[11:37] Obviously, I come here every single week
[11:40] to share these ideas with you. I'm not
[11:42] gloating. I'm just, you know, stating
[11:43] the facts of all the incredible work
[11:46] that we do here on the channel week
[11:47] after week after week. If this is your
[11:49] first time watching an Indie Dev Dan
[11:51] video, welcome to the channel. Uh, it is
[11:54] funny to think that, you know, some new
[11:58] subscribers think I'm a YouTuber.
[12:00] Uh, I'm not. I'm an agentic engineer.
[12:03] And many longtime followers of the
[12:05] channel are transforming into this role
[12:08] as well. One week at a time, one concept
[12:11] at a time. Just like Cloud Code, we've
[12:12] been on a hot streak focusing on the
[12:15] signal of what's going on in the space
[12:18] surrounding generative AI, prompt
[12:20] engineering, AI coding, and now agentic
[12:23] coding. Make sure you're subscribed so
[12:24] you don't miss the signal of what's
[12:27] going on. There's so much noise. Stay
[12:29] focused on the signal. Stay focused on
[12:31] valuable information like this. Okay,
[12:33] our agent is responding to us in user
[12:36] interface.
[12:38] Okay, this is extraordinary. Make sure
[12:40] you subscribe and make sure you take
[12:44] principled AI coding so you understand
[12:46] the fundamentals that agentic
[12:49] engineering is built on. Do this before
[12:51] the phase 2 engineering course hits. I'm
[12:54] working on that day and night to ship
[12:56] that on September 29th. Mark the date
[12:59] the countdown has started. Okay, this is
[13:01] the phase one course. Everything we do
[13:03] moving forward is based on the key
[13:06] principles of AI coding. Big idea here.
[13:08] You need to master the big three. This
[13:12] is going to be one of the last times I'm
[13:14] mentioning this course. After this, it's
[13:16] all in on phase two. This is risk-free,
[13:19] by the way. No questions asked refund
[13:22] before you start lesson four. So hop in
[13:24] here, master the basics so you can
[13:27] master the compositional ideas, right?
[13:30] The bigger ideas. I've been able to move
[13:32] so fast and ingest these features so
[13:35] quickly because I understand the
[13:38] fundamentals. Okay? And I built all the
[13:40] fundamentals you need to master AI
[13:42] coding and now agent coding in this
[13:44] course. Check this out. So, just to
[13:46] mention it, by the way, a question
[13:48] prompt like this is ultra valuable for
[13:51] speeding up the information flow between
[13:53] you and your agent. This helps prime
[13:55] your agent while giving you information
[13:58] you need to make engineering decisions.
[14:00] It's also great for helping your
[14:01] engineering team get up to speed as
[14:03] well. If you're a lead on your team or
[14:04] you want to add some value to your team,
[14:06] add this/quest prompt. Okay, so before
[14:09] we move on to how output styles work,
[14:13] let's talk about status lines.
[14:19] As you can see here, I have a pretty
[14:21] bare minimum status line. A lot of the
[14:24] status lines you've probably seen so far
[14:25] are like vibe coding. It's the lowest
[14:28] hanging fruit. When you combine hooks
[14:30] and a simple state management system,
[14:33] your status lines can become
[14:34] tremendously more valuable. Let me show
[14:36] you exactly what I mean. So I'm going to
[14:38] get rid of some instances here. Let's
[14:40] clear out and just focus on a single
[14:42] instance. Here we have a simple minimal
[14:46] status line. Model current working
[14:47] directory get branch plus the changes on
[14:49] committed or clawed code version. This
[14:52] is simple mostly static information.
[14:54] Let's update our status line to use a
[14:56] new format. I'll open up cursor go to my
[14:58] settings here. We'll search for status
[15:01] line. If we open up our folder structure
[15:02] here, I have a dedicated status lines
[15:06] directory with four versions giving us
[15:09] different status line outputs. Let's
[15:10] update to v2 and let's see exactly what
[15:13] this looks like. I'll close claude
[15:15] reopen and check this out. Now we have
[15:18] model and no recent prompt. So you can
[15:21] see exactly where this is going, right?
[15:22] I'll say hi. We now have our most recent
[15:25] prompt in the status line. So who cares
[15:28] what why is this important? Right? Isn't
[15:30] this kind of kind of stupid? If you
[15:32] follow this channel, you probably are
[15:34] running more than one cloud code
[15:36] instance at any time, right? Just like
[15:38] AI coding is not enough. One agent is
[15:41] not enough. As soon as you start using
[15:43] powerful agent coding tools like cloud
[15:45] code, especially cloud code, there are
[15:48] only two directions to go. Better agents
[15:50] or more agents. All right, output
[15:53] formats helps us with better agents.
[15:56] Status lines helps us with more agents.
[15:59] Okay, this is really really simple to
[16:01] portray here, right? Open up a new
[16:02] terminal window. Fire up claw code.
[16:04] Let's go YOLO mode in Opus. Let's update
[16:07] our output style just for fun. We'll use
[16:09] text to speech summary. This is a great
[16:12] format when you have multiple agents and
[16:14] you're working in parallel doing a lot
[16:16] of work, long running tasks. You can put
[16:18] on text to speech and when your agent
[16:19] finishes, it'll respond back to you. So,
[16:22] this is great for more and better
[16:23] agents. Here's the kicker. This says hi.
[16:26] I can say who's investing the most in AI
[16:29] data centers between and Google, right?
[16:33] Just any prompt, right? I'm just firing
[16:35] off whatever. And you can see here we
[16:36] have a brand new last executed prompt.
[16:39] Now, on its own, not very useful, right?
[16:41] But when you're switching instances all
[16:43] the time, uh tell me about this
[16:45] codebase, this becomes very useful.
[16:49] Okay, so we have one instance here, we
[16:51] have another instance here. Right? If
[16:53] you're really pushing this tool, you've
[16:55] likely opened up multiple and I'm
[16:57] talking three, five, ten instances of
[17:00] this tool and you're prompting all the
[17:02] time. Here's another prompt. Okay? And
[17:05] so it becomes very very helpful to have
[17:08] this last prompt status line to remind
[17:12] you what is going on. Right? So now I
[17:14] can just quickly look at this cloud code
[17:15] instance. I can read the status line and
[17:17] I can know okay yes that's what I was
[17:19] prompting. That's what I was working on
[17:21] in this specific instance. Okay. And so
[17:23] when you combine just a little bit of
[17:25] state with cloud code hooks with
[17:27] I'm ready to help but need you to share
[17:29] the complete prompt or question you
[17:30] mentioned
[17:32] with the status line you get a really
[17:34] really powerful capability here that
[17:37] builds on your agent coding tool. So you
[17:38] can see here our web starts firing off
[17:40] and you know when I look at this I can
[17:42] just immediately look at the status line
[17:43] right we have emojis based on if we're
[17:46] asking a question if we're creating new
[17:48] code right let's go ahead and do that
[17:49] here in a new instance right so claude
[17:52] um create a compressed read me based on
[17:56] read me like this right we have the
[17:59] create keyword here right an information
[18:01] dense keyword and now our recent prompt
[18:04] there we go we have that light bulb
[18:06] right because it's creating or updating
[18:07] something new. Okay. And so, you know,
[18:10] we're updating just a few things, right?
[18:11] We're using the tools.
[18:12] I've analyzed your Claude code hooks
[18:15] mastery codebase. It's an advanced
[18:17] toolkit for extending Claude code with
[18:19] hooks, sub aents, and custom behaviors.
[18:22] Wonderful. So, we got that texttospech
[18:24] response. Again, this is useful for
[18:26] interacting with multiple agents. This
[18:28] kind of replaces our stop hook text to
[18:31] speech response that we had that we've
[18:32] been using in previous videos. Now with
[18:34] the output styles, we can have our agent
[18:37] run a tool every time it finishes. In
[18:40] this case, the tool happens to be 11
[18:42] Labs text to speech. You know, I hope
[18:44] you're really paying attention to what
[18:47] you can do with this tool, right? Output
[18:49] styles in combination with the status
[18:51] lines. What does this do? What's the
[18:53] fundamental change that's happening
[18:54] here? We are increasing the information
[18:57] rate between ourselves and our agents,
[19:00] right? And when you push this further
[19:02] with something like
[19:03] created a compressed readme that cuts
[19:05] 650 lines down to 150 while keeping all
[19:09] essential information.
[19:10] Wonderful. And so when you push this
[19:12] even further, what do we get? Right. We
[19:14] get generative UI. Okay. Right. This is
[19:19] kind of you know where this is all
[19:20] going. I hope you guys can kind of see a
[19:22] larger picture here of how far you can
[19:25] push this tool. All right. And again you
[19:27] know if you're not subscribed join the
[19:28] journey. We focus on these big ideas
[19:30] every single week. I'm not waiting for
[19:32] the future to show up. I'm running
[19:33] toward it and I'm running toward it and
[19:35] sharing the ideas, sharing how you can
[19:38] also be using these tools. We have
[19:40] generative UI, right? We have powerful
[19:42] status lines to help us keep track of
[19:45] what the heck is going on. So, here's
[19:47] another generative UI response for that
[19:49] question I asked about data center
[19:51] investments. Cloud code did some
[19:52] research and created a breakdown for us.
[19:55] Clear winner here for AI data center.
[19:56] OpenAI Stargate 500 billion over four
[19:59] years. Pretty gnarly. A great breakdown.
[20:01] Again, generative UI. My agent just put
[20:04] this together for me. Here's a little
[20:05] timeline. And you know, always just a
[20:08] starting point, right? Every response,
[20:10] every prompt you write, every piece of
[20:12] context that gets added to your agent.
[20:14] This is just another tool, another
[20:17] leverage point for your agent coding.
[20:19] All right. So, fantastic. Really cool
[20:22] stuff here. Let's refocus back on the
[20:24] stats line. Now, you know, I have these
[20:25] four windows open, right? I'm doing a
[20:27] lot of work in parallel. I can cycle
[20:29] through these and know exactly what was
[20:31] going on, right? So, literally nothing
[20:32] was happening here. Just demoed prompt.
[20:34] But here, who's investing the most?
[20:35] Okay, now we can follow up on that. What
[20:37] else we have? Right. Create a compressed
[20:38] readme. Okay, fantastic. We also got
[20:41] that text to speech summary 650 down to
[20:44] this. Open that file. Of course, we're
[20:47] going to get that
[20:48] I've opened the compressed readme file
[20:49] for you to review
[20:50] texttospech response. Fantastic stuff.
[20:53] Let's go ahead and close out our
[20:54] instances here. Let's focus. That was
[20:56] just two status lines, right? Let's go
[20:58] to status line V3 and then I'll leave V4
[21:01] for you to experiment with. Here, let's
[21:03] fire up Claude once again. We'll run an
[21:05] opus with permissions. You can see here
[21:08] a very similar format until we start
[21:10] prompting. So, the new flow here for me
[21:12] is set my output format. Let's go ahead
[21:15] and set a YAML structured format here.
[21:17] And I'll say at we'll search for that
[21:19] new compress readme. What does this
[21:22] codebase do? Read only this file. So,
[21:26] we're just going to get a quick
[21:27] understanding and you're going to see
[21:28] something really incredible here. Our
[21:30] status line updated here. We have a name
[21:33] for our agent. Kind of a similar format,
[21:35] right? Opus is a little bit better at
[21:37] formatting YAML. We have a great
[21:39] YAMLbased response format. Again,
[21:41] there's something about this response
[21:43] format that improves this agent's
[21:45] performance. Definitely play around with
[21:47] this. Right? We said, what does this do?
[21:49] Read only this file. Task completed.
[21:51] Overview. Core functionality. Right.
[21:54] Eight life cycles for controlling cloud
[21:56] code. Yep. Sub aents. Okay. Meta agent.
[21:59] Very good. We covered that in the
[22:00] previous video. Custom features. Status
[22:02] line. Output formats. Very good.
[22:04] Technical stack. Love that. Astral UV.
[22:07] That's right. Shout out Astral. Use
[22:09] cases. Key innovations. Great stuff.
[22:12] Right. And our status line has the last
[22:14] prompt and an agent name. Another tool
[22:17] to scale your agents. And another
[22:19] example to showcase how you can use
[22:21] state that's getting updated throughout
[22:24] your session to guide your agent and to
[22:27] help you interact with your agents
[22:28] faster and better. Right? More agents,
[22:31] better agents. First you make your
[22:32] agents better, then you add more agents.
[22:35] Okay? Now read uh read me update your
[22:39] understanding.
[22:41] Okay? Something like that. And in this
[22:44] status line V3, we now have trailing
[22:46] prompts, right? So, historic trailing
[22:48] prompts. Here's the most up-to-date. And
[22:51] here's the second to last prompt that we
[22:53] ran. Okay. So, really powerful stuff
[22:55] here. I think you get the idea. As we're
[22:58] interacting with agents more and more as
[23:00] engineers, the key idea, the key value
[23:03] proposition is in increasing the
[23:06] information rate between you and your
[23:08] agent, right? Between you and the work
[23:11] that you're trying to do. These are big
[23:13] drops. I did mention in the beginning
[23:15] there are a couple features I'm not as
[23:17] happy about coming out of the cloud code
[23:19] team. Let's just quickly talk about
[23:21] those.
[23:25] There are a couple features I want to
[23:26] talk about that um I think might be
[23:29] pushing cloud code in the wrong
[23:30] direction my opinions but I want to
[23:32] share this with you. I want to get your
[23:34] thoughts on these as well. slashmodel
[23:36] [Music]
[23:38] opus plan mode. When you submit a
[23:40] prompt, Cloud Code is going to plan with
[23:42] Opus and then build with Sonnet. If
[23:44] you've been with the channel for a
[23:45] while, this feature might make you think
[23:48] of ADER, the original AI coding tool.
[23:51] ADER was one of the first AI coding
[23:53] tools to really leverage language
[23:55] models. This is traditional AI coding.
[23:57] It's not agent coding. There are no tool
[23:59] calls happening in ADR. That PR, that
[24:02] patch just hasn't gotten out. Ader was
[24:04] one of the first tools to build out a
[24:07] architect mode. We can see this great
[24:09] blog put back out in 2024. This was
[24:12] innovative because they used a prompt
[24:14] chain, right? Two prompts with two
[24:16] models. Ader separated thinking and
[24:19] building. Okay, this was really big. We
[24:21] had already talked about prompt chaining
[24:22] on the channel around this time. Why do
[24:24] I have an issue with this? Right? Why is
[24:26] plan, build, architect, builder
[24:29] something that I have beef with? The
[24:31] power of cloud code lies in its
[24:33] flexibility, control, and simplicity. As
[24:36] the creator Boris said, cloud code is a
[24:39] primitive. It's an engineering
[24:41] primitive. This feature uh feels like a
[24:44] slight overreach to me along with the
[24:47] bash background commands. To me, it
[24:50] feels like the beginning of loss of
[24:52] directional focus. They should let the
[24:54] engineer decide on the models, how
[24:57] they're used, the planning, the
[24:58] building, and things like background
[25:01] task management, right? Bash controls.
[25:03] You know, I can simplify everything I'm
[25:05] trying to say here a little further and
[25:08] just say, you know, don't tell me how to
[25:10] use the models. Don't tell me how to
[25:12] manage my bash commands in my background
[25:14] processes. Okay, this is something I
[25:16] always watch out for with every tool,
[25:18] right? Especially the leading tool. I
[25:20] have a guiding question that kind of
[25:22] helps me determine if a new feature is
[25:24] valuable or if it should even exist.
[25:26] Right? In the generative AI age, we
[25:28] always have to keep track of the context
[25:30] model and prompt every step of the way.
[25:32] The leading question here is, do I know
[25:35] exactly what the context, model, and
[25:37] prompt are at every step of the process
[25:41] in whatever tool I'm using? Okay. Any
[25:44] feature that obscures this or inserts an
[25:47] opinion about how you or I should manage
[25:50] the big three, it throws up a huge
[25:52] yellow, orange, red flag to me. Now, to
[25:55] be clear, uh both of these features are
[25:58] useful, right? Opus plan mode where you
[26:00] have opus plan and sonnet build quite
[26:03] useful feature I'm not saying it's not a
[26:05] valuable feature you can build a great
[26:07] feature that is directionally incorrect
[26:10] for your product for your mission for
[26:12] your stated engineering philosophy okay
[26:15] so maybe this is just me let me know
[26:16] what you think about this do you think
[26:18] that opus plan mode and background
[26:20] commands are a slight overreach from
[26:23] cloud code right from the team in cloud
[26:24] code is this the right you know set of
[26:27] features that they should be building
[26:28] out I I think this is the first sign of
[26:30] things going a little bit off course,
[26:32] but maybe I'm overanalyzing, being too
[26:34] detailed oriented. Let me know in the
[26:36] comments if you like this direction from
[26:38] cloud code separate from the individual
[26:40] features themselves. Again, I'm not
[26:42] saying background bash commands and opus
[26:46] plan aren't valuable features.
[26:52] So with that aside, you can see here
[26:54] that output styles and the status line
[26:57] increase the information rate between
[26:59] you and your agent. So let's quickly
[27:02] understand how this works. These are
[27:04] very simple features which I absolutely
[27:06] love. The cloud code team is keeping it
[27:08] simple. If we open up claude, open up
[27:11] output styles, you can see we have all
[27:13] of these output styles detailed here. We
[27:15] have a bullet points format that I just
[27:17] completely glossed over, right? We have
[27:19] our HTML structure. We have our
[27:21] markdown. And of course, we have the gen
[27:24] UI. This codebase is going to be
[27:25] available to you. Link in the
[27:28] description. By the way, if you made it
[27:29] to this point in the video and you tune
[27:31] in every single week and you're still
[27:33] not subscribed for some reason, what are
[27:35] you doing? Right? All of this work, all
[27:37] the ideas we talk about every single
[27:38] week and you can't press one button to
[27:40] show your appreciation, come on.
[27:41] Subscribe. Join the journey. Don't be
[27:43] weird about it. Okay? You're in good
[27:45] company. You know, I'm here delivering
[27:47] value for free for you every single
[27:50] week. So, hop on the train. Things are
[27:52] only going to continue to accelerate.
[27:54] So, that's GUI. Check this out. Again,
[27:55] link in the description. You can see how
[27:56] this works and you can tweak it to make
[27:58] it your own. You can see we have that
[27:59] key workflow step for these agentic
[28:03] workflows where we want our agent to
[28:04] take actions back to back to back. This
[28:06] is a great place to get a highle
[28:07] breakdown of what the prompt does
[28:08] exactly. So, that's that HTML structure
[28:11] TTS. It's all there. If we close that,
[28:13] we can focus on our status lines. And
[28:15] I've created a dedicated folder for
[28:17] this. Output styles is a anthropic
[28:19] specific directory. Status lines is
[28:21] something that I created just for
[28:23] organizational purposes. Just like the
[28:25] data directory here, we'll talk about in
[28:27] a second. You can see in the status line
[28:28] directory, the only thing you need to
[28:30] focus on is main, right? We read in the
[28:32] line. We generate whatever status line
[28:35] you want using whatever data you want,
[28:37] but most importantly, we're just
[28:38] printing it. That's it. That's how
[28:39] status lines work. And to run this
[28:42] specific status line, as you saw, all
[28:44] you need to do is add this to your
[28:46] do.claw settings file. You can see here
[28:49] we have that status line V3. And if we
[28:52] open up V3, uh you can see something
[28:54] really cool in combination with our claw
[28:58] code hook. If we look for user prompt,
[29:00] right, and we open up these files side
[29:01] by side, we are managing session data.
[29:05] So every cloud code prompt makes a
[29:08] contribution to our agent specific data.
[29:11] Right? So we have this new.cloud. If we
[29:13] open up data, you can see here I have a
[29:15] bunch of sessions. And if we open up one
[29:17] of the sessions, you can see here we
[29:19] have information about that particular
[29:21] session that we can update, write to and
[29:24] read from. Okay. So as you would expect,
[29:26] session ID, agent name, prompts. This is
[29:29] how we're populating our agent name and
[29:32] our prompt history, right? And we can
[29:34] keep prompting. Fantastic. Looks great.
[29:37] Just a random prompt just to showcase
[29:38] that, you know, we're tracking the three
[29:40] most recent prompts with this status
[29:43] line, right? And this is all because we
[29:45] have a simple state management system.
[29:47] Again, just JSON objects, super
[29:49] readable, very understandable. Um, and
[29:52] that's that, right? In the user prompt
[29:53] submit hook. Right here we have that
[29:55] cloud code hook. We are combining these
[29:57] two features to get more value out of
[29:59] them. Prompts append. If we don't have
[30:02] an agent name, we're doing something
[30:03] really awesome. If you remember from our
[30:05] GPT5 nano agents video, we were running
[30:09] GPTOSS 20 billion. Here we're doing that
[30:12] exact same thing. If we open up olama
[30:14] py, we're having a powerful ondevice
[30:17] model right on my MacBook. Generate
[30:19] unique names for our agent. This is a
[30:23] super simple, great use case for these
[30:25] agents. You can see here, generate agent
[30:27] name. This file is going to be here for
[30:29] you to check out. It's super simple.
[30:31] We're generating a one-word name, right?
[30:33] This is prompt engineering 101. That's
[30:34] it. The agent has 5 seconds to generate
[30:36] this or it falls back. And this is how
[30:38] we update state for our status lines.
[30:42] What you're seeing here, right, all
[30:44] these features that you've seen here in
[30:46] this video, these are essential ideas of
[30:48] what you can do with output styles. You
[30:50] can take this further and combine,
[30:52] merge, and add conditional branches
[30:54] directly in your output style system
[30:56] prompt to direct which output type your
[30:59] agent uses based on the prompt at hand.
[31:02] Okay, so if you want to take this even
[31:03] further, that's a great direction. And
[31:05] this is what makes Cloud Code so great.
[31:07] It's a new primitive of engineering.
[31:09] It's the engineers agent that's
[31:12] increasingly customizable and so far so
[31:15] good, very unopinionated. This is key.
[31:18] It's not a dedicated solution. This is
[31:21] what we as engineers need to solve any
[31:23] problem we face. And this is why again I
[31:25] feel like the plan mode and the bash
[31:28] command is starting to look like a
[31:31] slight overreach of this principle of
[31:33] being an unopinionated simple
[31:36] engineering primitive. Tell me what you
[31:37] think about that. Drop a comment down
[31:39] below. This codebase is available to
[31:41] you. Link in the description. No matter
[31:43] what, stay focused and keep building.
