## Why Senior Developers Default to Risk, Scaling, and Frameworks

Part of it is muscle memory. Senior developers have been trained, over years of post-mortems, production outages, and performance reviews, to start every discussion with what could go wrong. They've survived long enough to know that scaling issues, compliance nightmares, and brittle architectures can kill a project.

I just think in the AI coding era, this instinct has become a reflexive brake pedal.

They'll invoke risks that don't exist yet, scaling problems that may never materialize, or demand alignment with some "best practice" that isn't actually relevant.

These habits were learned in a different game, one where every line of code was expensive to produce, so you had to protect it like treasure.

(Also as a big sidenote, if you are a senior, then how the heck did you even learn in the first place?)

Let me guess? By making mistakes?

That's right, you learnt by building things badly, repeatedly, until the edges smoothed out. By trying, failing, and fixing, in live environments no less. No one handed you a perfect process; you earned your competence by getting your hands dirty. Just because you hand to grind through Stack Overflow and you took ages, doesn't mean what people are doing today is any worse.

I for one would have LOVED to have had AI while I was trawling through Stack Overflow, wasting hours, trying to figure out what the heck a class was and what a method means. It was so confusing and inefficient.
