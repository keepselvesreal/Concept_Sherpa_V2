## Juniors just keep putting the reps in

If you are getting lost by all the noise, my advice to you is put in the reps and just keep building. The tailwinds are in your favor. You have the entire world's AI labs and billions of dollars of investment being poured into this industry to basically make your job easier.

To seniors, get alongside and prop up the juniors. If security is a risk, teach them to what to look for. If the database schema sucks, use that as a teaching moment. Then bonus points if you update your AI workflows to make sure that never happens again.

Please just please stop banging on about your experience.
