## When Experience Becomes a Handicap

Psychologists call it the Dunning–Kruger effect, it's the gap between perceived and actual ability. Usually, it's beginners who overestimate themselves. But in AI coding, I've seen that the curve has flipped.

Veteran developers have genuine mastery in a world without AI. They've built careers on patterns, mental models, and workflows honed over decades. But when the terrain changes, those instincts misfire.

There's nothing wrong with their intelligence, but status is important. It's rampant in the software world. Levels of seniority are always spoken too first.

If you've been the "go-to" expert for years, you can't exactly be seen fumbling through prompts like a first-week junior. So you default to the posture of control:

AI outputs? Too messy. I'll just write it myself.
Generated code? Not production-ready. Let's throw it out.
Workflow advice from newcomers? Cute. Let the grown-ups handle it.

On the surface, this all sounds great. The thing that annoys me alot about this is the power imbalance. Sure you are senior, so what can the junior person possibly say to counter you here. First to claim justice wins.

I just think that in reality, this is all a defense mechanism. I also think it's extremely damaging to the thousands of people that are learning and being exposed to programming.
