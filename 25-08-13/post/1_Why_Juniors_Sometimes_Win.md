## Why Juniors Sometimes Win

Now I can speak to my own experience, in my own agency. It is the juniors who are adopting AI better than the seniors. They don't have any legacy habits and I'm noticing that they are learning the AI-first workflow much faster. I think it comes down to attitude.

This is a pattern I see again and again at other companies. It is often the junior engineers in the team that have used AI the most (don't get me started on the amount of senior developers who have huge claims about AI and then it turns out they have used it for an hour.)

But the juniors have prompt libraries, workflow tools and a whole bunch of quirky ways to get things done.

They're not burdened by "how things have always been done." They don't flinch at the idea of letting an AI write 80% of the boilerplate. They judge results on output quality, not on how "pure" the process looked.

In a perverse inversion of prestige, the less you've coded without AI, the faster you can get good at coding with AI.
