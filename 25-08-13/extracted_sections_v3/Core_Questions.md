## Core Questions

In this video we dive into fundamental agent coding and attempt to answer these questions:
- Can GPT5 compete with Opus 4.1? 
- Has useful on-device local LLM performance been achieved?
- What's the best way to organize all the compute available to you?

If these questions interest you, stick around and let's see how our agents perform on fundamental agentic coding tasks.
