## Detailed Test Results

Let's go ahead and hop back to the results. Pretty excited to share this with you here. But you can see how these prompts are set up - these are our agents and our lower order prompts just detail the exact benchmark that we want run. So on our dummy test the prompt is "what's the capital of the United States, respond in JSON format structure" so we can get all the auxiliary metadata coming out of the nano agent MCP server.

We have another interesting result here. We have the raw outputs. Here's all of our agents that executed - we had nine nano agents firing off. And then we have the respective responses. You can see here we're looking for first 10 lines and last 10 lines in the specific prompt format.
