## Initial Surprising Results

What just happened with this prompt? You can see here we have rankings. Surprisingly, we have Claude 3 Haiku outperforming all of our other models. If you look at this, it looks backward. We would expect these models to be on top and these other models to be on the bottom. What's going on?

We're evaluating all of our models against each other in a fair playing field where we care about performance, speed, and cost as a collective. These agents are operating in a nano agent, a new MCP server to create a fair playing field where every one of these models is scaffolded with the same context and prompt. Two of the big three. And then we get to see how they truly perform.

If we put these models inside Claude Code, I can guarantee you Opus and Sonnet will outperform. But you can see here for this extremely simple task, "what's the capital?" we can see very different results out of the box.
