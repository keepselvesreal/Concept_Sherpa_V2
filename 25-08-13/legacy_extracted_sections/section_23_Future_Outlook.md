## Future Outlook

But maybe you can go even further beyond and use a small on-device model. These are only going to get better. So you want to have the infrastructure in place and the tooling in place to understand the capabilities so when it's ready you can hop on it.

I can tell you right now I'm going to be investing more into these models across the board so I know what tasks can be accomplished by what model so I can make the right tradeoff. Engineering is all about tradeoffs: performance, speed, cost. At different times of the day, based on the task you're working on, different things matter.

So super long one. Thanks for sticking with me here. Stay focused and keep building.
