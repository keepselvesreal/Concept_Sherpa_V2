## Prompt Orchestration Technique

So this is the multi-model evaluation workflow. Higher order prompt, lower order prompt. We have models that call our nano agent MCP server and the whole point here is to create a true even playing field. You and I need to evaluate agentic behavior against these models and understand the tradeoffs they all have: performance, speed, cost. All of these mattered.

You can see our results coming in here. Let's go ahead and dive in to this codebase, the nano agent codebase, and understand exactly how this is formatted so that we can benchmark brand new fresh state-of-the-art models like GPT5 against the new Opus 4.1. And ultra excitingly, these brand new GPT open-source models, OpenAI absolutely cooked on these models. Again, these are running right on my machine right now.
