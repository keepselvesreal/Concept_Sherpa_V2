## Local Model Capabilities

You can imagine that we can just continue doing this along every other model we want to run. So you can see here, here's GPT5 mini. But we can easily just swap this out. You can see here there's nano, here's mini, here's five. And then we repeat the same thing for the correct OpenAI local models, which are absolutely mind-blowing.

We have 20 billion and 120 billion running right on my M4 Max MacBook Pro. This is a 128 GB unified memory machine. This thing is absolutely cracked. These models run on the device and they are doing agent decoding work as you'll see in these results.
