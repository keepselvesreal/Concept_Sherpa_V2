## Performance Analysis

And we are evaluating on performance. So did it do the job? Speed and cost. Obviously if the model can't do the job, it doesn't matter if it's fast or how much it costs or how cheap it is.

So, you can see kind of some rough grades here. If you look at the overall breakdown of this task, we have some rough grades. It's not all roses when you really flatten the playing field.

Take a look at Opus for instance. We all know that Opus costs, but we don't really realize how much this model costs. It's extraordinarily expensive. And you can see here, for some reason, GPT5 had to churn and turn and churn its output tokens to figure out how to get this response properly. Terrible cost there. I'm actually surprised this chewed up that many tokens. I've seen this run much better, but I have seen some weirdness with GPT5 through the API.
