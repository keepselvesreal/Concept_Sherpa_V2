# Introduction and Overview

It's incredible what you can do with a single prompt. We're running GPT5 Mini Nano right next to Opus, Opus 41, Sonnet, Haiku, and the new GPT OSS 20 billion and 120 billion that are running directly on my M4 Max MacBook Pro. 

You can hear the agents are completing their work. Agent complete in parallel - we have natural language responses coming back to us and at the end here we're going to get a concrete comparison of how these models performed across the most important three dimensions: performance, speed, and cost.

We have a brand new agentic model lineup that we need to break down in this video. We're going to look at a concrete way of how we can flatten the playing field to really understand how these models perform side by side. All of our cloud code sub agents running in their own respective nano agents have finished their work. All set and ready for the next step.

We have concrete responses and concrete grades for every single model. So we are using Claude code running Opus 4.1 in the LLM as a judge pattern to determine what models are giving us the best results. And you can see something really awesome here. Total cost on GPT OSS: $0.

## Core Questions

In this video we dive into fundamental agent coding and attempt to answer these questions:
- Can GPT5 compete with Opus 4.1? 
- Has useful on-device local LLM performance been achieved?
- What's the best way to organize all the compute available to you?

If these questions interest you, stick around and let's see how our agents perform on fundamental agentic coding tasks.

## Beyond Benchmark Regurgitation

As you've seen already, every single tech YouTuber, content creator, they've turned the camera on, recorded the screen, and literally just spat back out the benchmarks of all these brand new models back out to you. Just regurgitated exactly what the post tells you itself.

If you've been with the channel for any amount of time, you know that we don't do that here. We dive deeper. We actually use this technology and we develop a deep understanding so that we can choose and select the best tool for the job at hand.
