If we open up the terminal again, we can see how we're doing here. Looks like we are waiting on GPT OSS 20 billion and everyone else has completed. Not a ton of surprises there. On device does take some time to run. There we go. We just got that completed and now Claude code is going to formulate these results into a concrete response for us. It's going to do the evaluation.

So you can see those tokens streaming in there. Hopefully I still have enough Opus for a great evaluation here. Let's see how that goes. But so we have a higher order prompt here and then here's our eval one that we ran. This is our dummy test.
