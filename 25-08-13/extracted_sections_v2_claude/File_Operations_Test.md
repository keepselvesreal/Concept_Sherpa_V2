# File Operations Test

```text
We can take a look at the result. Let me just quickly show you exactly what that prompt looked like. So this is a lower order prompt basic read. So if we look at this, we have instructions and then we have variables. And the prompt here is the most important. So we're saying read the readme file. Provide exactly the first 10 lines and the last 10 lines of the file.

So this is an agentic task. This is a little more advanced. We're just stepping up the difficulty scale just a little bit from just asking a simple question. We just want it in this exact response format. So we're testing for instruction following. We're testing for tool use. In a second here, I'll show you the exact tools that our nano agent MCP server can call.

Then we fire off all of our agents and we have an expected output. So, we're just sticking to great prompt patterns. We're writing extraordinarily clearly to our agent, both our primary agent and our sub agents, and we're being really clear about the flow of communication between our agents. We need to make sure that we're orchestrating the communication extraordinarily well.

## Future Implications and Conclusions

So, that's what we're doing here. But the key here is: here's the agentic prompt that's running. Read the readme. Give me the first 10 lines and the last 10 lines. So this is what we're evaluating our models against. So now we can say for this fundamental agent decoding task, how did our models perform?
