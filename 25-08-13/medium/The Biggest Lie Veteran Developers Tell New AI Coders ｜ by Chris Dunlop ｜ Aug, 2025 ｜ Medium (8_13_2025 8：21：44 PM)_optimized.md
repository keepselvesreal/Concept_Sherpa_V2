# When Experience Becomes a Handicap

Psychologists call it the Dunning–Kruger effect, it’s the gap between perceived and actual ability. Usually, it’s beginners who overestimate themselves. But in AI coding, I’ve seen that the curve has flipped. Veteran developers have genuine mastery in a world without AI. They’ve built careers on patterns, mental models, and workflows honed over decades. But when the terrain changes, those instincts misfire.There’s nothing wrong with their intelligence, but status is important. It’s rampant in the software world. Levels of seniority are always spoken too first.If you’ve been the “go-to” expert for years, you can’t exactly be seen fumbling through prompts like a first-week junior. So you default to the posture of control:AI outputs? Too messy. I’ll just write it myself.Generated code? Not production-ready. Let’s throw it out.Workflow advice from newcomers? Cute. Let the grown-ups handle it.On the surface, this all sounds great. The thing that annoys me alot about this is the power imbalance. Sure you are senior, so what can the junior person possibly say to counter you here. First to claim justice wins.I just think that in reality, this is all a defense mechanism. I also think it’s extremely damaging to the thousands of people that are learning and being exposed to programming.Why Senior Developers Default to Risk, Scaling, and FrameworksPart of it is muscle memory. Senior developers have been trained, over years of post-mortems, production outages, and performance reviews, to start every discussion with what could go wrong. They’ve survived long enough to know that scaling issues, compliance nightmares, and brittle architectures can kill a project.I just think in the AI coding era, this instinct has become a reflexive brake pedal.They’ll invoke risks that don’t exist yet, scaling problems that may never materialize, or demand alignment with some “best practice” that isn’t actually relevant.These habits were learned in a different game, one where every line of code was expensive to produce, so you had to protect it like treasure.(Also as a big sidenote, if you are a senior, then how the heck did you even learn in the first place?)Let me guess? By making mistakes?That’s right, you learnt by building things badly, repeatedly, until the edges smoothed out. By trying, failing, and fixing, in live environments no less. No one handed you a perfect process; you earned your competence by getting your hands dirty. Just because you hand to grind through Stack Overflow and you took ages, doesn’t mean what people are doing today is any worse.I for one would have LOVED to have had AI while I was trawling through Stack Overflow, wasting hours, trying to figure out what the heck a class was and what a method means. It was so confusing and inefficient.Be Nice To Your Formal SelfI’d just encourage you before you critique all these tools, to imagine yourself starting out as a graduate. Was the way you learnt really that optimal? Wouldn’t AI have been the best thing ever?Remember the joy that you experienced when you made something work.If you are just downbuzzing on AI for all the potential problems then this is the exact process that you are denying new AI coders today.The Old Workflow Is the Wrong WorkflowMost veterans use AI like Stack Overflow on steroids — a place to grab snippets. That’s a tragic underuse of the tool.The old cycle was:Analyze requirementsWrite all code manuallyTest, refactor, deployNow we have AI, the cycle is different:Frame the problem in precise promptsGenerate multiple solution pathsDiff-check and refine iteratively with the modelIntegrate only the best fragments into productionIt’s a shift from writing to orchestrating. Just reframe what you are doing from “crafting every line” to “designing the system that gets those lines written.”Here’s what Paul Graham has to say:Press enter or click to view image in full sizeWhy Juniors Sometimes WinNow I can speak to my own experience, in my own agency. It is the juniors who are adopting AI better than the seniors. They don’t have any legacy habits and I’m noticing that they are learning the AI-first workflow much faster. I think it comes down to attitude.This is a pattern I see again and again at other companies. It is often the junior engineers in the team that have used AI the most (don’t get me started on the amount of senior developers who have huge claims about AI and then it turns out they have used it for an hour.)But the juniors have prompt libraries, workflow tools and a whole bunch of quirky ways to get things done.They’re not burdened by “how things have always been done.” They don’t flinch at the idea of letting an AI write 80% of the boilerplate. They judge results on output quality, not on how “pure” the process looked.In a perverse inversion of prestige, the less you’ve coded without AI, the faster you can get good at coding with AI.The Thing I Respect About You As A Senior Engineer NowStatus used to come from writing systems from scratch and hand crafting everything. Now everything has changed, the new game is about how little you have to type to ship something valuable.Like in what world is my above sentence not true? Help me to understand? This is the story of the history of technology. We move up levels of abstractions. Things get faster. Particularly in technology.You know what I really respect about a senior engineer now?Them getting alongside the junior team, utilizing the juniors eagerness and desire to learn and helping provide the guardrails. Bouncing off as a team, coming up with really creative workflows together.That’s so much cooler than hearing for the 1000th time some niche edge case about why something doesn’t work because you haven’t spent enough time trying.Juniors just keep putting the reps inIf you are getting lost by all the noise, my advice to you is put in the reps and just keep building. The tailwinds are in your favor. You have the entire world’s AI labs and billions of dollars of investment being poured into this industry to basically make your job easier.To seniors, get alongside and prop up the juniors. If security is a risk, teach them to what to look for. If the database schema sucks, use that as a teaching moment. Then bonus points if you update your AI workflows to make sure that never happens again.Please just please stop banging on about your experience.

# Why Senior Developers Default to Risk, Scaling, and Frameworks

Part of it is muscle memory. Senior developers have been trained, over years of post-mortems, production outages, and performance reviews, to start every discussion with *what could go wrong* . They’ve survived long enough to know that scaling issues, compliance nightmares, and brittle architectures can kill a project.
