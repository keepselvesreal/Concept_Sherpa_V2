# Why Agents Matter

In this video we dive into fundamental agent coding and attempt to answer these questions:
- Can GPT5 compete with Opus 4.1? 
- Has useful on-device local LLM performance been achieved?
- What's the best way to organize all the compute available to you?

If these questions interest you, stick around and let's see how our agents perform on fundamental agentic coding tasks.

### Beyond Benchmark Regurgitation

As you've seen already, every single tech YouTuber, content creator, they've turned the camera on, recorded the screen, and literally just spat back out the benchmarks of all these brand new models back out to you. Just regurgitated exactly what the post tells you itself.

If you've been with the channel for any amount of time, you know that we don't do that here. We dive deeper. We actually use this technology and we develop a deep understanding so that we can choose and select the best tool for the job at hand.

## Model Evaluation Framework

There is one trend that matters above all. Right now, it doesn't matter if we're talking about GPT5, whatever Anthropic has cooking next, the cursor CLI or any other model that's getting put out right now, open source, closed source, there is one thing everyone is focused on. If you've been paying any attention, you know exactly what it is. It is the agent architecture.

### Why Agents Matter

Why does everyone care so much about agents? First, let's understand how you and I, engineers with our boots on the ground, can have a better, deeper understanding of these models' agentic performance. It's not about a single prompt call anymore. It's about how well your agent chains together multiple tools to accomplish real engineering results on your behalf.
