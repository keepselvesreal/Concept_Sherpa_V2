# Breakthrough Week Assessment

### Context and Compute Revolution

This has been a breakthrough week. It's very clear to me that there is more compute than ever to tap into. I'm able to understand and move and work through these innovations because I understand the industry at a fundamental level.

Everything we do is based off just one concept. The big three: context, model, and prompt. Everything is based off these. If you understand these, you can build evals, you can build benchmarks, you can build agents because they're all just scaffolded on top of these.
