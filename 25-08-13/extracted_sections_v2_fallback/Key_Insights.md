# Key Insights

Looking at the document for the "Key Insights" section between "Key Insights" and "Future Outlook", I can see that there is a "### Key Insights" subsection, but it appears to be within a larger section. Let me extract the content that falls between these headers:

So, we have more compute than ever. It's not about the prompt anymore. It's not about the individual model anymore. It's about what the model can do in long chains of tool calls. The true value proposition of models is being exposed. It's real work end to end.

And the thing to keep an eye on is: do you know how to trade off performance, cost, and speed when the time is right? Because I can guarantee you, you don't always need Opus 4. You might be able to settle with GPT5, which is much cheaper, by the way, than Opus 4. Or you might be able to go further. You can just use five mini. Maybe you need to scale to Sonnet four for that task. Fine.

But maybe you can build your own specialized small agent. You can build off from the nano agent codebase that is going to be available to you. Link in the description. I'm going to clean this up and make sure it's available for you so that you can understand agentic coding at a fundamental level.
