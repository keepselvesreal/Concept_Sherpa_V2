# Initial Surprising Results

The document does not contain a section titled "Initial Surprising Results" or "Testing Scenarios and Results" as specified in your request. 

Looking at the actual document structure, I can see sections like:
- "Introduction and Overview"
- "Core Questions" 
- "Beyond Benchmark Regurgitation"
- "Model Evaluation Framework"
- "Why Agents Matter"
- "Testing Scenarios and Results"
- "Technical Implementation Details"
- etc.

However, there is no section specifically titled "Initial Surprising Results" in this document. Could you please:

1. Double-check the exact section titles you're looking for
2. Or provide the correct section names that exist in this document
3. Or clarify if you meant a different section (perhaps "Why Agents Matter" or another subsection)?

I want to ensure I extract exactly what you need, but I need the correct section headers that actually exist in the document.
