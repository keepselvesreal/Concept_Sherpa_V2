1.1.4 The implementation phase
After this detailed investigation of Theo’s diagrams, Dave lets it sink in as he slowly sips his
coffee. He then expresses his admiration to Theo.
Dave Wow! That’s amazing!
Theo Thank you.
Dave I didn’t realize people were really spending the time to write down their design
in such detail before coding.
Theo I always do that. It saves me lot of time during the coding phase.
Dave When will you start coding?
Theo When I finish my latte.
Theo grabs his coffee mug and notices that his hot latte has become an iced latte. He was
so excited to show his class diagram to Dave that he forgot to drink it!
