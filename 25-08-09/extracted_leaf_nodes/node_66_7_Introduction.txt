At first glance, it may seem that embracing DOP means accessing data without validat-
ing it and engaging in wishful thinking, where data is always valid. In fact, data valida-
tion is not only possible but recommended when we follow data-oriented principles.
This chapter illustrates how to validate data when data is represented with
generic data structures. It focuses on data validation occurring at the boundaries of
the system, while in part 3, we will deal with validating data as it flows through the
system. This chapter is a deep dive into the fourth principle of DOP.
