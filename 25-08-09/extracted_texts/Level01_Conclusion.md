Conclusion 363
 The cost for implementing Principle #4 includes
– Weak connection between data and its schema
– A small performance hit
Conclusion
DOP simplifies the design and implementation of information systems by treating
data as a first-class citizen. This is made possible by adhering to four language-agnostic
core principles (see figure A.5):
 Separating code from data.
 Representing application data with generic data structures.
 Treating data as immutable.
 Separating data schema from data representation.
Principle #2: Represent Immutable
data with generic data
structures.

Figure A.5 The principles of DOP
This appendix has illustrated how each principle can be applied both in FP and OOP
languages. It also describes at a high level the benefits of each principle and the costs
of adherence to it.
