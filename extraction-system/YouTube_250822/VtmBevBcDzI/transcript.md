[00:00] Before you even think about launching
[00:01] your product, there's one thing that
[00:03] will make or break your success. And
[00:05] most people completely mess this up.
[00:07] They rush to build their product first,
[00:08] then throw together some generic landing
[00:10] page at the last minute. But here's the
[00:12] reality. Your product gets judged by
[00:14] your landing page quality, and if that
[00:16] looks amateur, your product will too.
[00:18] Now, with AI, everyone thinks making
[00:20] landing pages is easy. You just go to
[00:22] cursor or claw, type make me a landing
[00:24] page, you get something with gradients
[00:26] and cards. but it looks exactly like
[00:28] every other AI generated site out there.
[00:30] Boring, generic, and definitely not
[00:32] premium. Well, today I'm going to show
[00:34] you how to fix that. So, I was scrolling
[00:37] through X and stumbled upon this post by
[00:39] Legion's dev. They had shared a public
[00:41] template for designing landing pages and
[00:43] I thought it looked incredibly
[00:45] professional and amazing. There were so
[00:47] many small details that made it appear
[00:49] completely human-designed rather than AI
[00:51] generated. I went ahead and opened up
[00:53] the chat in V 0ero since that's where it
[00:56] had been designed. You can see the whole
[00:57] conversation right here. Upon opening it
[00:59] and testing it out, I noticed subtle
[01:02] details that made the website even more
[01:04] responsive. So, what I did was read
[01:06] through his prompts carefully. I wanted
[01:07] to create a template so that anyone
[01:09] could easily achieve amazing designs
[01:11] like these regardless of which AI agent
[01:14] they were using. First, I tried giving
[01:16] the same prompts he used to Claude Code.
[01:18] After the first and second attempts,
[01:20] Claude code didn't generate anything
[01:21] close to what I wanted. For example, it
[01:24] needed to create this specific design
[01:26] component. But Claude code just produced
[01:28] some kind of basic dot structure
[01:30] instead. I even tried providing the
[01:32] description of what Vzero had actually
[01:34] implemented, but it still didn't produce
[01:36] the desired result. It just added a
[01:38] gradient to the previous result, and it
[01:40] still didn't look that great. So, here's
[01:42] what I did. I copied the final result
[01:44] from the site and broke it down
[01:45] completely. I took the end result, the
[01:48] actual code along with some of the
[01:49] original prompts he used. Now, I'm going
[01:51] to share the best tips and insights for
[01:53] creating amazing websites like these
[01:55] using a detailed breakdown of the
[01:57] website that was built on Vzero. Now, a
[01:59] quick break to tell you about today's
[02:01] sponsor, Chat LLM. So many AI tools out
[02:03] there, but buying them all expensive and
[02:06] messy. Now, you don't have to. Chat LLM

[02:52] or click the link in the description
[02:53] now. Okay, so the first thing you'll
[02:55] notice that makes this website look so
[02:57] good is the interactive background it
[02:59] has. I've seen AI generate backgrounds
[03:02] before, even gradients, but I haven't
[03:04] seen it make them this impressive.
[03:05] Looking into the code and his prompts, I
[03:07] found that he was using paper shaders, a
[03:10] library for creating these amazing
[03:12] looking backgrounds for websites. At
[03:14] first, I tried asking Claude Code to use
[03:16] this library and generate good
[03:18] backgrounds, but it failed. For some
[03:19] reason, it just didn't understand what
[03:21] actually looked better, unlike this
[03:23] example. Now, Vzero did get this right
[03:25] on the first try, as you can see from
[03:27] his prompt. But when I gave the same
[03:28] prompt to Claude Code, it really messed
[03:30] things up. So, here's what I did and
[03:32] here's how you can generate these
[03:33] amazing backgrounds for your own
[03:35] website. First, you need to explicitly
[03:37] tell Claude Code that you're using paper
[03:39] shaders and specify the design clearly.
[03:41] The next step is to use this already
[03:43] prepared prompt. These details are
[03:45] actually what I extracted from his
[03:47] website. I went back to GitHub, used
[03:49] Gitingest, and it basically transformed
[03:51] the repo into AI readable text. Since
[03:53] it's not a big repo, I then pasted it
[03:56] into clawed code and had a focused
[03:58] conversation with it. I gave it the
[03:59] exact design you see here using this
[04:02] specific prompt and it produced other
[04:04] amazing backgrounds with the same
[04:05] library. Don't worry about the prompts
[04:07] and resources. You'll find all of them
[04:09] in the resources section of this video.
[04:11] Essentially, in the context window of
[04:13] this chat, only the background details
[04:15] are included. That's more effective than
[04:17] just handing the entire codebase to
[04:19] Claude Code. This is why I prefer this
[04:21] separation approach. I even had Claude
[04:24] Code implement a drop down with
[04:25] different styles so I could show you the
[04:27] variety of backgrounds it came up with.
[04:29] For example, here's this water droplet
[04:31] moving across the screen. Then there are
[04:33] these small cell animations. They're
[04:35] moving really slowly, but they're still
[04:37] animating beautifully. There are
[04:38] different types of animations and you
[04:40] can generate many variations with claw
[04:42] code. You can change the colors, ask it
[04:44] for different options, and experiment
[04:46] freely. The main thing I discovered was
[04:48] that after giving it this prompt, it
[04:50] unlocked some kind of improvement.
[04:52] Before this, most of the designs it
[04:54] generated had no animation whatsoever.
[04:56] But afterwards, the designs looked
[04:58] incredible. Just look at this background
[05:00] right here. It looks absolutely amazing.
[05:03] This is what actually makes your landing
[05:05] pages beautiful. Amazing backgrounds
[05:07] along with the other elements we'll
[05:09] discuss next. Now, next up on the
[05:11] website, you'll see down here this small
[05:13] rotating circle which displays V 0 is
[05:15] amazing while it animates. Over here,
[05:17] you'll notice a small pop-up or merge
[05:19] animation as well. I also noticed that
[05:21] along the way, the author tried to
[05:23] implement even more animations. And I
[05:25] know that many of you when implementing
[05:27] animations, just tell AI to go ahead and
[05:30] add them. But that's actually not the
[05:32] correct approach. Using specific
[05:33] libraries for animations is a much
[05:35] better practice because the AI doesn't
[05:37] have to create everything from scratch.
[05:39] Instead, it leverages a library that's
[05:41] already built to handle animations
[05:43] professionally. One of the best
[05:45] libraries for this, something AI models
[05:47] are actually very skilled with, is
[05:49] Framer Motion. Basically, you just
[05:51] import it, and it offers pre-made,
[05:53] amazing looking animations for all kinds
[05:55] of elements, including buttons,
[05:56] components, and more. So, here's what
[05:58] you should do. Whenever you're
[06:00] implementing an animation, make sure to
[06:02] use this approach. For example, if you
[06:04] wanted to implement this rotating circle
[06:06] animation right here, you would ask the
[06:08] AI to create a rotating circle with
[06:10] text. But along with that request, you'd
[06:12] also provide this prompt telling it to
[06:14] use framer motion for React, which is
[06:16] the React version of the framer motion
[06:18] library. When you do this, the results
[06:20] are significantly better. Even in my own
[06:22] testing, I've seen countless examples
[06:24] where simply using this library makes
[06:26] animations smoother and more stable.
[06:28] Because these animations are
[06:29] preconfigured within a library rather
[06:31] than being custom code, there's a much
[06:33] lower chance of things breaking. For
[06:35] instance, if I change the background of
[06:37] this website, the moving element
[06:39] animations wouldn't randomly break
[06:41] because they're built with Frame
[06:42] Motion's reliable foundation. So
[06:44] definitely try to use this library as
[06:46] often as you can whenever you're
[06:48] implementing animations. So, on the
[06:50] topic of this particular animation, it's
[06:52] actually really amazing to see these
[06:54] little quality animations because they
[06:56] make the whole website experience so
[06:58] much better. On that note, I'll leave a
[07:00] list of additional animations in the
[07:02] description. Basically, if you were to
[07:04] implement this effect, it wouldn't just
[07:06] be a simple mouse cursor or a small
[07:08] circle popping out from the side. What
[07:10] actually happened here was a gooey
[07:12] morphing effect. That means these are
[07:14] two separate elements that have been
[07:16] morphed together using this gooey
[07:18] animation technique. So here's how you
[07:20] do it. First, have the AI create two
[07:22] separate elements. For example, tell it
[07:24] to make a login button and then a small
[07:26] arrow circle. After that, give it a
[07:28] prompt to apply a gooey morphing
[07:30] animation between them and again specify
[07:32] that it should use framer motion for
[07:35] this effect. This is how you'll achieve
[07:36] these small but incredibly impactful
[07:38] animations. Also, I went ahead and found
[07:41] some other examples as well and tested
[07:43] them thoroughly. You'll be able to
[07:44] access all of those in the resources
[07:46] section, too. So, next up, another small
[07:49] detail that really makes the website
[07:50] look impressive, is the different font
[07:52] choices the author used. They didn't
[07:54] just stick to the normal default font
[07:56] that AI usually generates, which
[07:58] wouldn't have helped the overall look of
[08:00] the site. By implementing a different
[08:02] font, especially for a single word, it
[08:04] adds a tremendous amount of character to
[08:06] the landing page. The go-to place for
[08:08] getting fonts is Google fonts. You can
[08:10] go there and implementing the fonts you
[08:12] find is really straightforward. For
[08:13] example, I saw this font that I liked
[08:16] and to implement it, I simply copied the
[08:18] code and told Claude code to add it.
[08:20] Here you can see that I asked it to
[08:22] apply the font specifically to the word
[08:24] beautiful and I provided the link I
[08:26] copied. It went ahead and implemented it
[08:28] perfectly. Now, even though the font I
[08:30] tried isn't necessarily better than the
[08:32] one that was already there, it
[08:34] demonstrates how easily you can
[08:36] customize it. So, definitely try out
[08:38] different fonts on your websites. Just
[08:40] like they did here with specific words,
[08:42] it makes your site look much more
[08:43] polished and gives it significantly more
[08:46] character. Now, when you actually look
[08:48] at the site, in my opinion, it looks
[08:50] absolutely amazing. Along with the
[08:52] gradient and the fonts, another crucial
[08:54] factor is the layout they chose. For
[08:56] example, when they implemented the
[08:58] wording, you can see that instead of
[08:59] putting it in the center, they
[09:01] purposefully placed it in the bottom
[09:02] left corner, that made it look
[09:04] significantly better. For this, you
[09:06] basically need to know some website
[09:08] layouts you can use to improve your
[09:09] designs. You don't have to reinvent the
[09:11] wheel. You can simply take inspiration
[09:13] from websites that are already out
[09:15] there. For that, I found a website
[09:17] gallery called Landbook, which I've been
[09:19] using recently for design inspiration.
[09:21] You can find different layouts,
[09:22] structures, and mapping styles for
[09:24] websites, and they provide excellent
[09:26] ideas. Just look at this one right here.
[09:28] In my opinion, it looks incredible, and
[09:30] it's essentially just a layout. For
[09:32] example, if you were making a landing
[09:33] page for an agricultural product, this
[09:35] could easily work. All you'd need to do
[09:37] is give a screenshot of this to Claude
[09:39] Code and tell it to use agricultural
[09:41] images along with your logo. But if I
[09:43] had just gone to Claude Code saying,
[09:45] "Hey, I want to make a landing page."
[09:47] Even if I added fonts and backgrounds
[09:49] without a proper structure or a unique
[09:51] layout, the results wouldn't look
[09:52] impressive. Just look at this site right
[09:54] here. It has so many of the same
[09:56] qualities as the one the original author
[09:58] made. Short chunks of text with
[10:00] different fonts, animated backgrounds,
[10:02] and a distinctive layout. All of that
[10:04] combined makes your landing pages look
[10:06] truly professional. And honestly, all
[10:08] you have to do is take a screenshot and
[10:10] give it to Clawude Code. That's it. They
[10:12] even provide a color palette, which is
[10:14] also fantastic. So, make sure to use
[10:16] that as well. While I was looking at the
[10:18] chat from the author, I noticed how he
[10:20] implemented the V0ero brand logo. He
[10:22] didn't just ask to implement the logo or
[10:24] provide an image. Instead, he supplied
[10:26] the SVG code for it. This is much better
[10:29] compared to the alternatives. The reason
[10:31] is that SVGs are represented in code
[10:33] since these logos are built from
[10:35] different shapes. This makes it much
[10:36] easier for the model to understand them
[10:38] compared to providing images and asking
[10:40] it to add those images. This also gives
[10:42] you extra flexibility. Adding icons and
[10:45] images as SVGs gives you access to
[10:47] additional features. You can animate
[10:49] these SVG icons using Frame Motion and
[10:52] create really amazing animated drawn
[10:54] icons. SVGs are easy to find and there
[10:56] are plenty of resources available. I
[10:58] list several of these resources. Take a
[11:00] look at this site where you can find a
[11:02] lot of SVG logos for different brands.
[11:04] If I want the V0ero logo, I search for
[11:06] it and there it is. Clicking on it
[11:08] copies the SVG to my clipboard. When I
[11:10] go back to my terminal and paste it, I
[11:12] get the SVG code. From there, I can
[11:14] animate it or use it directly in my app.
[11:16] Besides icons, there are also many sites
[11:19] with SVG illustrations that look really
[11:21] amazing. They're important for certain
[11:23] sites, and while they weren't necessary
[11:25] in our case, they're still an amazing
[11:27] resource when building professional
[11:28] landing pages. Simply download these
[11:30] SVGs and provide them to Claude Code,
[11:32] and implementation becomes easy. Since
[11:34] SVGs are made of shapes, they're easily
[11:36] edited. Colors can be changed to match
[11:38] your brand, making them a really great
[11:40] resource. That brings us to the end of
