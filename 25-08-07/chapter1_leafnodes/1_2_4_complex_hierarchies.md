# 1.2.4 Complex class hierarchies

One way to avoid writing the same code twice in OOP involves class inheritance. Indeed,
when every requirement of the system is known up front, you design your class hier-
archy is such a way that classes with common behavior derive from a base class.
Figure 1.15 shows an example of this pattern that focuses on the part of our class
diagram that deals with members and librarians. Both Librarians and Members need
the ability to log in, and they inherit this ability from the User class.
So far, so good, but when new requirements are introduced after the system is imple-
mented, it's a completely different story. Fast forward to Monday, March 29th, at 11:00 AM,
where two days are left before the deadline (Wednesday at midnight).
Nancy calls Theo with an urgent request. Theo is not sure if it's a dream or reality. He
pinches himself and he can feel the jolt. It's definitely reality!
Nancy How is the project doing?
Theo Fine, Nancy. We're on schedule to meet the deadline. We're running our last
round of regression tests now.
Nancy Fantastic! It means we have time for adding a tiny feature to the system, right?
Theo Depends what you mean by "tiny."
Nancy We need to add VIP members to the system.
Theo What do you mean by VIP members?
Nancy VIP members are allowed to add book items to the library by themselves.
Theo Hmm...
Nancy What?
Theo That's not a tiny change!
Nancy Why?
I'll ask you the same question Nancy asked Theo: why is adding VIP members to our
system not a tiny task? After all, Theo has already written the code that allows librari-
ans to add book items to the library (it's in Librarian::addBookItem). What prevents
him from reusing this code for VIP members? The reason is that, in OOP, the code is
locked into classes as methods.
TIP In OOP, code is locked into classes.
VIP members are members that are allowed to add book items to the library by them-
selves. Theo decomposes the customer requirements into two pieces:
 VIP members are library members.
 VIP members are allowed to add book items to the library by themselves.
Theo then decides that he needs a new class, VIPMember. For the first requirement
(VIP members are library members), it seems reasonable to make VIPMember derive
from Member. However, handling the second requirement (VIP members are allowed
to add book items) is more complex. He cannot make a VIPMember derive from
Librarian because the relation between VIPMember and Librarian is not linear:
 On one hand, VIP members are like librarians in that they are allowed to add
book items.
 On the other hand, VIP members are not like librarians in that they are not
allowed to block members or list the books lent to a member.
The problem is that the code that adds book items is locked in the Librarian class.
There is no way for the VIPMember class to use this code.
Figure 1.16 shows one possible solution that makes the code of Librarian::add-
BookItem available to both Librarian and VIPMember classes. Here are the changes to
the previous class diagram:
 A base class UserWithBookItemRight extends User.
 addBookItem moves from Librarian to UserWithBookItemRight.
 Both VIPMember and Librarian extend UserWithBookItemRight.
It wasn't easy, but Theo manages to handle the change on time, thanks to an all nighter
coding on his laptop. He was even able to add new tests to the system and run the regres-
sion tests again. However, he was so excited that he didn't pay attention to the diamond
problem VIPMember introduced in his class diagram due to multiple inheritance: VIPMember
extends both Member and UserWithBookItemRight, which both extend User.
Wednesday, March 31, at 10:00 AM (14 hours before the deadline), Theo calls Nancy to
tell her the good news.
Theo We were able to add VIP members to the system on time, Nancy.
Nancy Fantastic! I told you it was a tiny feature.
Theo Yeah, well...
Nancy Look, I was going to call you anyway. I just finished a meeting with my business
partner, and we realized that we need another tiny feature before the launch.
Will you be able to handle it before the deadline?
Theo Again, it depends what you mean by "tiny."
Nancy We need to add Super members to the system.
Theo What do you mean by Super members?
Nancy Super members are allowed to list the books lent to other members.
Theo Err...
Nancy What?
Theo That's not a tiny change!
Nancy Why?
As with VIP members, adding Super members to the system requires changes to Theo's
class hierarchy. Figure 1.17 shows the solution Theo has in mind.
The addition of Super members has made the system really complex. Theo suddenly
notices that he has three diamonds in his class diagramâ€”not gemstones but three "Deadly
Diamonds of Death" as OOP developers sometimes name the ambiguity that arises when a
class D inherits from two classes B and C, where both inherit from class A!
He tries to avoid the diamonds by transforming the User class into an interface and
using the composition over inheritance design pattern. But with the stress of the deadline
looming, he isn't able to use all of his brain cells. In fact, the system has become so com-
plex, he's unable to deliver the system by the deadline. Theo tells himself that he should
have used composition instead of class inheritance. But, it's too late now.
TIP In OOP, prefer composition over class inheritance.
At 10:00 PM, two hours before the deadline, Theo calls Nancy to explain the situation.
Theo Look Nancy, we really did our best, but we won't be able to add Super mem-
bers to the system before the deadline.
Nancy No worries, my business partner and I decided to omit this feature for now.
We'll add it later.
With mixed feelings of anger and relief, Theo stops pacing around his office. He realizes
he will be spending tonight in his own bed, rather than plowing away on his computer at
the office. That should make his wife happy.
Theo I guess that means we're ready for the launch tomorrow morning.
Nancy Yes. We'll offer this new product for a month or so, and if we get good market
traction, we'll move forward with a bigger project.
Theo Cool. Let's be in touch in a month then. Good luck on the launch!
