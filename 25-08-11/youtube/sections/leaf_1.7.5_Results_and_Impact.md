### 1.7.5 Results and Impact

So basically we designed this system to be understandable and verifiable even without us reading all the code. And so ultimately by combining those things we were able to become just as confident in this change as any other change that we made to our codebase but deliver it in a tiny fraction of the time and effort that it would have taken to write this entire thing by hand and review every line of it.

And I think one of the really exciting things about this is not just that this saved us a week's worth of human time, but knowing that we could do this, it made us think differently about our engineering, about what we could do. And now suddenly when something costs one day of time instead of two weeks, you realize that you can go and make much bigger features and much bigger changes. The marginal cost of software is lower and it lets you consume and build more software.

So I think that was the really exciting thing about this is not just saving the time but now kind of feeling like oh things that are going to take two weeks let's just do them. It's only going to take a day. And that's kind of the exciting thing here.
