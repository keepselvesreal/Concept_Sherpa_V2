### 1.9.2 Planning and Information Balance

**Question**: Going back to your pre-planning process, what's the balance between giving it too much information and too little? Are you giving it a full product requirement document? Is there kind of a standardized template that you put together before you actually move into vibe coding?

**Eric**: Yeah. I think it depends a lot on what you care about. I would say that for things where I don't really care how it does it, I won't talk at all about the implementation details. I'll just say these are my requirements like this is what I want at the end. There's other times where I know the codebase well and I will go into much more depth of like, hey, these are the classes you should use to implement this logic. Look at this example of a similar feature.

I'd say it all comes down to what you care about at the end of the day. I would say though that our models do best when you don't over constrain them. So, you know, if I wouldn't put too much effort into creating a very rigorous format or anything. I would just think about it as like a junior engineer what you would give them in order to succeed.
