### 1.5.1 The Technical Debt Problem

Now I have one caveat to that today which is tech debt. So right now there is not a good way to measure or validate tech debt without reading the code yourself. Most other systems in life you know like the accountant example, the PM, you know, you have ways to verify the things you care about without knowing the implementation. Tech debt I think is one of those rare things where there really isn't a good way to validate it other than being an expert in the implementation itself.
