### 1.6.1 Acting as Claude's Product Manager

So let's talk about how to succeed at vibe coding. And my main advice here is ask not what Claude can do for you but what you can do for Claude. I think when you're vibe coding you are basically acting as a product manager for Claude. So you need to think like a product manager. What guidance or context would a new employee on your team need to succeed at this task?

I think a lot of times we're too used to doing a very quick back and forth chat with AI of make this feature, fix this bug, but a human if it was their first day on the job and you just said, "Hey, implement this feature," there's no way you'd expect them to actually succeed at that. You need to give them a tour of the codebase. You need to tell them what are the actual requirements and specifications and constraints that they need to understand.
