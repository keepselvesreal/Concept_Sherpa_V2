### 1.5.3 Future Model Improvements

Now the one thing I will say here is that the models are getting better all the time and so we might get to a world where this gets further and further down where we trust the models more and more to write code that is extensible and doesn't have tech debt. Using the Claude 4 models over the last week or two within Anthropic has been a really exciting thing and I've given them much more trust than I did with 3.7. So I think that this is going to change and more and more of the stack we will be able to work with in this way.
