### 1.7.4 Verification Strategy

And lastly, we carefully designed stress tests for stability. And we designed the whole system so that it would have very easily human verifiable inputs and outputs. And what that let us do these last two pieces is it let us create these sort of verifiable checkpoints so that we could make sure that this was correct even without understanding or reading the full underlying implementation.

Our biggest concern was stability and we were able to measure that even without reading the code by creating these stress tests and running them for long durations. And we were able to verify correctness based on the input and outputs of the system that we designed it to have.
