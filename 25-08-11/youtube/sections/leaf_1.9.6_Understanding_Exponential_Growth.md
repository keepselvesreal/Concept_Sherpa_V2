### 1.9.6 Understanding Exponential Growth

**Question**: Thank you for the very fascinating talk. I also appreciate that you've done what a lot of people haven't done and tried to interpret one of the more peculiar lines in Karpathy's original post, embrace exponentials. So, I wonder if I could pin you down a little more and say, how would I know if I've embraced the exponentials? Like, what precisely means following that advice? And to maybe put it down a little more in what I think it intends to mean, it sort of maybe alludes to this, the models will get better. Do you think there's some legitimacy in saying just the fact that the models will get better doesn't mean they'll get better at every conceivable dimension we might be imagining we hope they'll be in.

**Eric**: Yeah. So how do I embrace exponentials? Yeah, absolutely. So the I think you got close with the quote of keep assuming the models are going to get better, but it's a step beyond that. The idea of the exponential is not just that they're going to keep getting better, but they're going to get better faster than we can possibly imagine.

And that's kind of like when you can see the shape of the dots here. It's not just that it's getting steadily better, it's that it's getting better and then it goes wild. I think the other funny quote I heard from this this was in Dario and Mike Krieger's talk is machines of loving grace is not science fiction. It's a product roadmap. Even though it sounds like something that's very far out like when you are on an exponential things get wild very fast and faster than you expect.

And I think, you know, if you talk to someone that was doing computers in the 90s, it's like, okay, great. We have a couple kilobytes of RAM. We have a couple more kilobytes of RAM. But if you fast forward to where we are now, it's like we have terabytes. And it's not just that it got twice as good, it's that things got millions of times better. And that's what happens with exponentials over a course of 20 years.

So, we shouldn't think about 20 years from now as what happens if these models are twice as good. We should think about what happens if these models are a million times smarter and faster than they are today, which is wild. We can't even think about what that means. In the same way that someone working on computers in the 90s, I don't think they could think about what would happen to society if a computer was a million times faster than what they were working with. But that's what happened.

And so that's what we mean by the exponential is it's going to go bonkers.
