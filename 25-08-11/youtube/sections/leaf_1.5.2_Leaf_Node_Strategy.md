### 1.5.2 Leaf Node Strategy

So that is the one thing that right now we do not have a good way to validate. However, that doesn't mean that we can't do this at all. It just means we need to be very smart and targeted where we can take advantage of coding. My answer to this is to focus on leaf nodes in our codebase. And what I mean by that is parts of the code and parts of our system that nothing depends on them. They are kind of the end feature. They're the end bells and whistles rather than things that are the branch or trunks beneath them like here in white.

Here the orange dots are all these leaf nodes where honestly if you have a system like this it's kind of okay if there is tech debt in these leaf nodes because nothing else depends on them. They're unlikely to change. They're unlikely to have further things built on them versus the things that are in white here, the trunks and the underlying branches of your system. That is the core architecture that we as engineers still need to deeply understand because that's what's going to change. That's what other things are going to be built on and it's very important that we protect those and make sure that they stay extensible and understandable and flexible.
