## Practical Example and Setup Process

Here's a practical example. In my test projects doc section, I can add project specific sources. Say I'm building a Swift app and Liquid Glass UI just released. LLMs don't know about it yet. The solution is feeding Archon the Swift UI documentation.

I added the docs to the knowledge base, set the crawl depth to two, which is optimal, and let the crawler process everything. The crawler works programmatically. It follows every link on the site, navigates through menus, enters each page, and extracts all information systematically.

This is a comprehensive system combining context engineering, RAG, web scraping, and task management in one platform. When our community creates something this powerful, others build on it to create even more innovative tools. That's the beauty of this community.
