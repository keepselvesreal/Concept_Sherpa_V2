## Task Management and Knowledge Base Integration

The tasks tab works beautifully with your documentation based on your project scope, meaning what you want to build. The backlog automatically populates with relevant tasks. The AI agent manages tasks independently and maintains task memory. It never loses context and always knows which tasks need completion.

You can create unlimited projects and manage them efficiently. In my task class project, for instance, one task sits in the backlog while 13 are actively in progress.

Next is the MCP server which connects Archon to your AI agents. Setup is remarkably simple. They have setup commands for all agents like Claude Code whose command is really hard to search up. This is especially valuable for users uncomfortable with code editors or terminals.
