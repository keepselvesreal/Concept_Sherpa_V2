## Current Limitations and Problems in AI Coding

AI coding is constantly evolving. Whether you use Claude Code or Cursor, it doesn't matter. People are realizing that simply giving a large prompt to your AI coder is not enough anymore. This realization led to the introduction of context engineering a while back.

Context engineering is basically the art of filling the context window of the model with only the stuff that it needs to know for a specific task. Sounds good in theory, right? But here's the issue. You never follow a set path when coding. You encounter errors. You might need to implement something new or you discover you need additional context midway through. When that happens, you're stuck. You need to constantly update your context.
