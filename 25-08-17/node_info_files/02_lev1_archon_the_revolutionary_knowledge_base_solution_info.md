## Archon: The Revolutionary Knowledge Base Solution

What you really need is your own knowledge base. And not just any knowledge base, but one through which the AI agent can get the accurate data it wants as fast as possible. This is where this new agent system, Archon, comes in.

Let's start with the projects tab. I have two projects here, a test project and a task glass project. Each project contains two essential tabs, docs and tasks. This is your complete context management system. Your documentation lives here giving your AI agent full knowledge of your project.

When I open this, you'll notice they've added templates. This means when your AI agent connects, whether it's Claude or Cursor, it doesn't create random documentation. It follows these templates like architecture documentation or feature PRDs, keeping everything properly organized.
