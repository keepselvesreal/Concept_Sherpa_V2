## Installation and Configuration Guide

So, this is the GitHub repository of Archon. And the first thing you're going to do is come here and copy the link. Then you'll go back into your terminal. You're going to clone the GitHub repository and add it inside your chosen directory.

After the GitHub repository is installed, you're going to run this specific command that's shown right here in the GitHub repository. This command will create your env file where you need to put some important variables.

Now, since Archon is a proper knowledge hub, it needs a proper database to perform RAG and all the AI searching capabilities that it provides. For this, the author has chosen to use Supabase as the main database. And setting it up is really simple. The great thing is you don't need to pay for this. The free version of Supabase is absolutely enough for what we need.

Next, you need to create your database tables inside Supabase. But don't worry about having to do that manually. They've provided an automatically configured setup that makes this incredibly easy. All you have to do is open the current repository inside Cursor so you can easily access all the files.
