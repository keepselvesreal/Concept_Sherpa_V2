## Powerful RAG System and Web Crawling

Here's the feature that makes Archon exceptional, the knowledge base. The knowledge base accepts any documentation you need. You can add links to any tools documentation. For example, I imported the entire Swift UI documentation from Apple's developer site. That's 505 pages containing over 126,000 words.

In the add knowledge base section, you'll find categories of knowledge. You can add URLs or hosted documentation sites. The applications extend beyond AI coding. You can personalize documentation and create knowledge bases for anything. You can also upload PDFs for custom knowledge or internal documentation.

What makes this different from other tools? Archon implements a complete RAG system. When you install it, you're setting up a proper database for RAG instead of simple text search. The system stores data and applies semantic search. The result is fast, accurate, and personalized retrieval.
