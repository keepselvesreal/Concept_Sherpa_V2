# Retrieval Agents ACTUALLY Solved AI Coding's Biggest Problem

## Current Limitations and Problems in AI Coding

AI coding is constantly evolving. Whether you use Claude Code or Cursor, it doesn't matter. People are realizing that simply giving a large prompt to your AI coder is not enough anymore. This realization led to the introduction of context engineering a while back.

Context engineering is basically the art of filling the context window of the model with only the stuff that it needs to know for a specific task. Sounds good in theory, right? But here's the issue. You never follow a set path when coding. You encounter errors. You might need to implement something new or you discover you need additional context midway through. When that happens, you're stuck. You need to constantly update your context.

## Archon: The Revolutionary Knowledge Base Solution

What you really need is your own knowledge base. And not just any knowledge base, but one through which the AI agent can get the accurate data it wants as fast as possible. This is where this new agent system, Archon, comes in.

Let's start with the projects tab. I have two projects here, a test project and a task glass project. Each project contains two essential tabs, docs and tasks. This is your complete context management system. Your documentation lives here giving your AI agent full knowledge of your project.

When I open this, you'll notice they've added templates. This means when your AI agent connects, whether it's Claude or Cursor, it doesn't create random documentation. It follows these templates like architecture documentation or feature PRDs, keeping everything properly organized.

## Task Management and Knowledge Base Integration

The tasks tab works beautifully with your documentation based on your project scope, meaning what you want to build. The backlog automatically populates with relevant tasks. The AI agent manages tasks independently and maintains task memory. It never loses context and always knows which tasks need completion.

You can create unlimited projects and manage them efficiently. In my task class project, for instance, one task sits in the backlog while 13 are actively in progress.

Next is the MCP server which connects Archon to your AI agents. Setup is remarkably simple. They have setup commands for all agents like Claude Code whose command is really hard to search up. This is especially valuable for users uncomfortable with code editors or terminals.

## Powerful RAG System and Web Crawling

Here's the feature that makes Archon exceptional, the knowledge base. The knowledge base accepts any documentation you need. You can add links to any tools documentation. For example, I imported the entire Swift UI documentation from Apple's developer site. That's 505 pages containing over 126,000 words.

In the add knowledge base section, you'll find categories of knowledge. You can add URLs or hosted documentation sites. The applications extend beyond AI coding. You can personalize documentation and create knowledge bases for anything. You can also upload PDFs for custom knowledge or internal documentation.

What makes this different from other tools? Archon implements a complete RAG system. When you install it, you're setting up a proper database for RAG instead of simple text search. The system stores data and applies semantic search. The result is fast, accurate, and personalized retrieval.

## Practical Example and Setup Process

Here's a practical example. In my test projects doc section, I can add project specific sources. Say I'm building a Swift app and Liquid Glass UI just released. LLMs don't know about it yet. The solution is feeding Archon the Swift UI documentation.

I added the docs to the knowledge base, set the crawl depth to two, which is optimal, and let the crawler process everything. The crawler works programmatically. It follows every link on the site, navigates through menus, enters each page, and extracts all information systematically.

This is a comprehensive system combining context engineering, RAG, web scraping, and task management in one platform. When our community creates something this powerful, others build on it to create even more innovative tools. That's the beauty of this community.

## Installation and Configuration Guide

So, this is the GitHub repository of Archon. And the first thing you're going to do is come here and copy the link. Then you'll go back into your terminal. You're going to clone the GitHub repository and add it inside your chosen directory.

After the GitHub repository is installed, you're going to run this specific command that's shown right here in the GitHub repository. This command will create your env file where you need to put some important variables.

Now, since Archon is a proper knowledge hub, it needs a proper database to perform RAG and all the AI searching capabilities that it provides. For this, the author has chosen to use Supabase as the main database. And setting it up is really simple. The great thing is you don't need to pay for this. The free version of Supabase is absolutely enough for what we need.

Next, you need to create your database tables inside Supabase. But don't worry about having to do that manually. They've provided an automatically configured setup that makes this incredibly easy. All you have to do is open the current repository inside Cursor so you can easily access all the files.

## Real Development Process and Results

After you've set everything up and your services are running, when you open the front-end link in your browser, you're going to be greeted with this onboarding flow. The first thing you'll need is an additional API key. You can go ahead and choose between Google Gemini or OpenAI for this.

The reason you need to provide another API key is for the RAG implementation. To make RAG work, the system needs to convert the words in your documents into numbers based on their meaning. This conversion process is what makes the search so fast and accurate and it requires a model to create these meaningful numerical representations.

First, you create a new project like I did. After creating the project, I went into Claude Code and asked it to search for all the projects. It fetched my project and returned the ID along with the description. In that description, I had defined that it should only use local storage, follow a specific architecture, and be built with Swift UI.

Next, I told it that I wanted to build the app and provided some requirements. For example, I specified that it must use Liquid Glass and that I just wanted two pages in the app for now. Think of this step as writing a PRD and you can discuss this with Claude Code and finalize this.

Think of your coding agent as the tool that's only there to execute tasks while Archon is the context box where all your knowledge and instructions live. Going back to the process, once the documentation was ready and it had the Swift UI knowledge base in it, it needed to create tasks.

Now you might wonder how it knows when to use the documentation. Before as you know the big issue was that giving some context for a single task and many times that context wouldn't turn out to be enough. With Archon, this problem is completely solved. The coding agent is integrated with Archon so that whenever it feels even the slightest uncertainty, it automatically fetches the required documentation.
